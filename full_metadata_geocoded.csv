Ervin Abadi,"""Part of the Lager"" (Bergen Belsen) by Ervin Abadi. Watercolor, ink and colored graphite pencil drawing.Ervin Abadi, a Hungarian Jew from Budapest, was an aspiring young artist when WWII began.  He was drafted into the Hungarian labor service in the early 1940s.  Abadi managed to escape, but  was recaptured and immediately deported to Bergen-Belsen.  When the camp was liberated, his condition was such that he required extended hospitalization.  During his convalescence, he created dozens of works of holocaust art, including ink drawings, pencil and ink sketches and  watercolors.After recuperating Abadi returned to Budapest, where he published a collection of his watercolors in 1946.  After becoming disillusioned with the communist regime in Hungary, he moved to Israel, where he continued to publish in Hungarian and Hebrew.  He died in Israel in 1980.","United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Gyorgy Beifeld,"A page of drawings illustrating the contribution of Hungarian Jewish labor servicemen to the war effort.  At the top: ""The different platoons work hard at the battle front and in the no man's land [between the armies].  They actively participate in the fighting.  They carry ammunition to the Hungarian soldiers.""  In the middle: ""They defuse land mines.  They bury the dead, including those that had been left unburied from the winter campaign.  They carry soldiers wounded on the front lines to safety.""  At the bottom: ""For example, [Jewish Labor Serviceman] Herman Brand carried 35 wounded soldiers from the barbed wire barricades and from no man's land on May 30, 1942 during the Afanasyevica skirmish.  Among those he carried was Gyula Gercsi-Suta, age 35, a lieutenant, who succumbed to his wounds at the field hospital that evening.""One page of an illustrated album produced by Gyorgy Beifeld (1902-1982), a Hungarian Jew from Budapest, who was drafted into the Munkaszolgalat (Hungarian Labor Service system) and spent more than a year on the Soviet front, from April 1942 through May 1943.

Alfred Bergel,"Portrait of Marie Kleinova signed by Alfred Bergel on September 10, 1944. Caption translation: ""This woman lived in Terezin for the three years under the mark Aul-813. Until May 15, 1942 her name was Marie Kleinove. After the war, she and her sister Rudolfa changed their names to Klanova since they did not have a German name. Marie was born on December 3, 1907 as the last child of her father Leopold Klein and her mother Bedriska (Dubska). Since the time she was 15, Marie worked in an office. In her free time she read a lot; she always loved nature above anything else. Since it happened that Marie and Ruda, rather than Erna and Veruska, survived Hitler's reign of terror, it was well that they saved Erna's drawings and diaries and ... notebooks from ... niece Vera Segerova (Frantiska's daughter). The fate prevailed over our wishes. The picture was drawn by a Professor from Vienna.Used in the DOR pamphlet  ""Fifty Years Ago:  Darkness Before Dawn"" (1994).","United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

Simon Jeruchim,"Two watercolor paintings by Simon Jeruchim depicting the home of his rescuer, Madame Prim.  Above is the room where the artist slept.  He shared the room with Madame Prim.  He slept on the right, and she on the left.  She was very arthritic and needed the chair to help her get in and out of bed.  The floors were made of dirt, and a few slate tiles were kept on the floor near the fireplace for cooking.  Here they made soup and stews from potatoes.  On the mantel and on either side of the fireplace are depictions of saints.

During one of the visits with a friend of my father in the ghetto, I didn't eat anything on this particular day and probably they saw the hunger in my face because my father's friend asked me if I ate something that day, and I lied and said yes. He had one thin slice of bread that he smuggled from forced labor with the Germans, that he wanted to divide the slice of bread into two. But I did not agree, because there was nothing to divide.

Arie Singer,"Watercolor by Arie Singer dated December 12, 1941, the night he and his family were transported by the Germans to the ghetto in Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). It depicts a truck with a swastika broken down in the snow. Arie is pictured with a family group standing behind the truck. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie. When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units who, with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Soviet Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those supected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Hannah Messinger,"One of a series of pencil drawings created around 1970 by Hannah Messinger based upon her experiences as an inmate in several concentration and labor camps from 1941-1945. It depicts a gaunt figure standing behind a kneeling woman and 3 children. In December 1941, Hannah, her husband Karel Kohorn, and her family were deported from German-occupied Prague to Theresienstadt labor camp. In mid-1942, Hannah had an abortion to avoid deportation to Poland. In September 1944, the family was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. That January, Hannah was transferred to Sackisch and then Merzdorf forced labor camps. On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the camp. Hannah walked to the Czechoslovak border where she collapsed; her friends took her to a hospital where she was placed in a crib because she only weighed 70 pounds and they thought she was a child. Upon her release, she returned to Prague and learned that all her family members were murdered. She evntually found relatives in Budapest and, through them, met Imre Messinger, a survivor of Soviet labor camps. Hannah emigrated to the United States on December 21, 1946, and Imre joined her in 1947.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Illustration created by 24 year old Edward Herzbaum in Italy in 1944 of a memorable encounter he had when he was an inmate in a Soviet forced labor camp in 1941. The drawing depicts the hydroelectric plant and reservoir in Szeksna (now Rybinsk, Russia) where Edward worked on a boat pump. He often went to the pier to swim. This day, August 27, 1941, he watched unseen as a young female laborer washed herself, then cried briefly, before noticing and reacting to his presence. See 2012.471.74 and.76 for other versions. It was drawn in 1943-1944 when his unit, the 2nd Polish Corps, was training with the British Army in the Middle East. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. They fought their way north and were in Italy in May 1945 when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He resumed the study of architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then worked for two years with the Polish Resettlement Corps and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Unknown,"Watercolor made for 16 year old Johanna Hirsch by another prisoner, E. Ettlinger, in Camp de Gurs, France, where she was interned from 1940-1941. It depicts barracks with laundry and trash outside and barbed wire fence poles receding towards distant snowcovered mountains. See 2004.233.4 and 5 for other drawing by Ettlinger. For Hanne, one of the worst things about the camp was that there was nothing for the inmates to do. Many crafted items to fight the tedium, and also to possibly earn a few pennies or barter with the items. Hanne and her mother Ella were deported from Karlsruhe, Germany, to Gurs in October 1940. In September 1941, Hanne was rescued from the camp by OSE (Oeuvre Secours aux Enfants/ Aid to Children) and placed in a children's home in Le Chambon. When the Germans started rounding up Jews in the countryside, OSE found Hanne hiding places on two farms. In 1943, Hanne obtained false identity papers and escaped over the Alps to Switzerland. After the war ended in May 1945, Hanne married Max Liebmann, a fellow deportee from Germany whom she had met in Gurs. Ella had been deported and killed in Auschwitz concentration camp. Hanne and Max emigrated to the United States in 1948.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ava K. Schieber,"Self portrait in Drawn by Ava Hegedish when, from age 15 to 18, she lived in hiding at the farm of a Serbian Christian peasant family near Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia.) In April 1941, Nazi Germany and its Axis partners partitioned Yugoslavia. Belgrade was under German control. Ava's father Leo decided the family's best chance of survival was to separate and go into hiding. He returned to Novy Sad; her mother and her sister Susanna remained in Belgrade. Susanna's Greek Orthodox husband had Serbian relatives with a farm near Belgrade and they agreed to take in Ava, then 15. She did farm labor and lived in this shed. To avoid suspicion and because she did not speak the local Serbian dialect, Ava pretended to be deaf and mute. She sometimes got scraps of paper and made drawings to hold onto her sense of self and her memories of her family. The region was liberated in October 1944. Ava searched for family in Belgrade. She learned that her sister was killed and her father murdered in Auschwitz. She was reunited with her mother and they settled in Belgrade where Ava attended art school.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

E. Ettlinger,"Colored pencil and ink drawing made for 16 year old Johanna Hirsch by another prisoner, E. Ettlinger, in Camp de Gurs, France, where she was interned from 1940-1941. It depicts the tombstones of three friends who died at the camp, Rosa Adler, Herbert Mecklenberg, and Peter Meier. See 2004.233.4 and 5 for other drawing by Ettlinger. For Hanne, one of the worst things about the camp was that there was nothing for the inmates to do. Many crafted items to fight the tedium, and also to possibly earn a few pennies or barter with the items. Hanne and her mother Ella were deported from Karlsruhe, Germany, to Gurs in October 1940. In September 1941, Hanne was rescued from the camp by OSE (Oeuvre Secours aux Enfants/ Aid to Children) and placed in a children's home in Le Chambon. When the Germans started rounding up Jews in the countryside, OSE found Hanne hiding places on two farms. In 1943, Hanne obtained false identity papers and escaped over the Alps to Switzerland. After the war ended in May 1945, Hanne married Max Liebmann, a fellow deportee from Germany whom she had met in Gurs. Ella had been deported and killed in Auschwitz concentration camp. Hanne and Max emigrated to the United States in 1948.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while writing for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1930-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Framed oil painting created by David Friedmann (from 1960, Friedman) in 1946, depicting a scene in the Łódź Ghetto, where he was incarcerated from October 1941 until his deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in late August 1944. It depicts a large group of Jews in their attic living space.David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Ava K.

In April 1941, Germany and the Axis partners partitioned Yugoslavia. Belgrade was under German control. Jews were ordered to register, and Ava's father Leo decided the family's best chance of survival was to separate and go into hiding. He returned to Novy Sad. Ava's mother got false papers and remained in Belgrade with Ava's older sister Susanna, who married her Greek Orthodox fiance. The fiance had Serbian relatives with a farm near Belgrade and they agreed to take in Ava, then 15. She did farm labor and, to avoid suspicion and because she did not speak the local Serbian dialect, pretended to be deaf and mute. Ava sometimes got scraps of paper and made drawings to hold onto her sense of self and her memories of her family. The region was liberated in October 1944. Ava searched for family and learned that her sister was killed and her father and his mother were murdered in Auschwitz. She was reunited with her mother and they settled in Belgrade.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

Arie Singer,"Watercolor by Arie Singer depicting a midsection of three floors of an apartment building; people with Stars of David on thier brgihtly colored clothes can be doing daily activities, such as eatling, sleeping, and washing dishes.  It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth in the Glembokie ghetto and later as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans.

S.I. Zviely and D. Toppel,"Anti-Nazi caricature depicting animals with the faces of prominent Nazi leaders, published in Palestine in the early 1940s. If the instructions on the paper are followed, and the sheet is properly folded, the joined animals will create an image of Adolf Hitler. To escape persecution from the Nazis, many German and European Jews began immigrating to Palestine, which was awarded to Great Britain following World War I. Before and after the British takeover, successive waves of immigration (Aliyots) dramatically increased the region’s Jewish population. However, during this period of immigration, Britain placed strict limits on the number of Jews that could enter the country to ameliorate Arab concerns about the increasing Jewish immigration. During the war, thousands of Palestinian Jewish volunteers served in the British Army, and on September 14, 1944 a Jewish Brigade was established.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use.

Julius Isaacsohn,"Original design for a coat created by Julius Isaacsohn, a Jewish designer with his own garment making business in prewar Berlin, Germany. In 1938, Julius and his wife Gertrud, a dressmaker with her own business, had lost their livelihood because of the anti-Semitic policies of the Nazi regime. They sent their daughter Dorit, age 6, to Brussels, Belgium, in early 1939, to stay with Gertrud’s sister Anna Kaufman. Germany invaded Belgium in May 1940, and Gertrud and Julius had Dorit returned to them in 1941.

Hannah Messinger,"One of a series of pencil drawings created around 1970 by Hannah Messinger based upon her experiences as an inmate in several concentration and labor camps from 1941-1945. It depicts an old woman gesturing with upraised arms. In December 1941, Hannah, her husband Karel Kohorn, and her family were deported from German-occupied Prague to Theresienstadt labor camp. Hannah had an abortion to avoid deportation to Poland. In September 1944, they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. That January, Hannah was transferred to Sackisch and then Merzdorf forced labor camps. On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the camp. Hannah walked to the Czechoslovak border where she collapsed; her friends took her to a hospital where she was placed in a crib because she only weighed 70 pounds and they thought she was a child. Upon her release, she returned to Prague and learned that all her family members were murdered. Hannah emigrated to the United States on December 21, 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Lili Andrieux,"Self-portrait of Lili Andrieux, a German Jewish internee at Gurs internment camp.  Lili created over 100 detailed drawings of people and daily life in the internment camps where she was held from May 1940 - September 1942 in France. Alençon was a collection center for transport to Camp de Gurs in Vichy France. After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. She was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. When she recovered, she escaped and, with the help of the resistance, lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Oil painting created by David Friedmann (from 1960, Friedman) in 1946 after his return to Prague. It depicts a scene in the Łódź Ghetto, where he was incarcerated from October 1941 until his deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in late August 1944.. It is a portrait in muted browns of a young woman resting on a bed. The model was Friedmann's second wife, Hildegard Taussig. David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Hannah Messinger,"One of a series of pencil drawings created around 1970 by Hannah Messinger based upon her experiences as an inmate in several concentration and labor camps from 1941-1945. It depicts a seated old woman flanked by a woman and girl. In December 1941, Hannah, her husband Karel Kohorn, and her family were deported from German-occupied Prague to Theresienstadt labor camp. Hannah had an abortion to avoid deportation to Poland. In September 1944, they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. That January, Hannah was transferred to Sackisch and then Merzdorf forced labor camps. On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the camp. Hannah walked to the Czechoslovak border where she collapsed; her friends took her to a hospital where she was placed in a crib because she only weighed 70 pounds and they thought she was a child. Upon her release, she returned to Prague and learned that all her family members were murdered. Hannah emigrated to the United States on December 21, 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arthur Weisz,"Woodcut which Charles (Chaim) Flaum gave to his son Georges for his 12th birthday ca. 1942. It was made by another inmate, Arthur Weisz, at the internment camp where Charles was being held and has images of daily life at Camp Pithiviers. Georges lived with his parents, Charles and Therese, in Paris. In May 1940, France was invaded by Nazi Germany. The June armistice placed Paris under a German military administration which enacted anti-Jewish policies. On May 14, 1941, Charles was sent to Pithiviers internment camp. Georges and his mother were able to visit him there ca. 1942, around Georges's 12th birthday, when he received the woodcut, a quill, and a walking stick. On July 26, 1942, Therese was arrested. She yelled to Georges to run and he escaped to the home of his maternal uncle, Max Hirszberg. Max’s Catholic wife Edmee helped Georges create a false identity as a Christian using his maternal grandmother’s name, Banet. He then lived in hiding with a series of families for the next two years. Paris was liberated in August 1944 and Georges returned to Paris. His parents had been deported in summer 1942 to Auschwitz, where they perished. In December 1946, Georges left for the home of a relative, Albert Banet, in America.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Mixed media painting created by Arie Singer depicting life in the ghetto in Glembokie (Hlybokaye), Belarus, from 1941-1943. This image shows 2 lines of people with Stars of David on their backs waiting to go through the wooden gate to their forced labor assignments. This is part of a series of works about daily life in the Glembokie ghetto. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Watercolor by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting himself as a young boy with his parents begni inspected by soldiers at a Glembokie ghetto checkpoint. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Jacob J. Barosin,"Drawing depicting Jacob Barosin’s experiences while interned or living in hiding in southern France from June 1940 to August 1943. In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, France, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp.

On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean.

Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Palestine Government Press Office,"Anti-Nazi cartoon published in Palestine in the early 1940s, with a quote attributed to the book of Proverbs from the Hebrew Bible. The quote is erroneously attributed to Proverbs 21. verse 24 but it is actually Proverbs 21:23. Posters urging the public to be discrete about what information they reveal in conversations with strangers were common during World War II. Both the United States’ Security of War Information Campaign (also known as the Hush-Hush Campaign), and Britain’s Careless Talk Series were created to deliver similar messages. Following World War I, The League of Nations awarded control of Palestine to Great Britain. After the British takeover, successive waves of immigration (Aliyots) dramatically increased the region’s Jewish population. During the Nazis rise to power, and outbreak of World War II, thousands of European Jews attempted to escape to Palestine. However, Britain placed strict limits on the number of Jews that could enter the country to ameliorate Arab concerns about the increasing Jewish immigration. During the war, thousands of Palestinian Jewish volunteers served in the British Army, and on September 14, 1944 a Jewish Brigade was established.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use.

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting German Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while he was the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1936-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting the night of December 20, 1941, when he and his family were deported to the Glembokie ghetto. It shows him as a young boy getting out of a truck in front of a gated entrance as German and Lithuanian soldiers and Jewish men talk in the foreground. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s.

Harold Lehman,"Gouache study on board by Harold Lehman depicting four uniformed soldiers, one from each of the major Allied nations of WWII. Gouache is an opaque watercolor paint. It has a heavy, velvety texture that absorbs light rather than reflecting it, which gives the paint a smooth appearance. The image was made while Lehman was working at the Siquieros Experimental Workshop in New York City and was the original sketch for a parade float for New York City’s United Front parade in 1941. The float was an advertisement for donations for the Red Cross. An award winning painter, muralist and sculptor, Harold Lehman was known for making political statements with his artwork. He was born and raised in New York City, but moved to Los Angeles as a teenager, attending the Otis Art Institute. While in L.A. he worked with Phil Guston, Jackson Pollock, D.A. Siqueiros, and Manuel Tolegain. In 1941, Harold moved back to New York and continued his career, working with the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and the Federal Art Project, both New Deal programs to employ artists. He also worked with the Treasury department and Abbott Laboratories to create War Bond advertisements, pro-American propaganda, and anti-fascist pieces.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Harold Lehman,"Painting on board by Harold Lehman featuring a Civil Defense worker turning a valve on a large L shaped pipe. In the prelude to American involvement in World War II, the public feared attacks on populated areas, similar to those that were taking place in Europe.

Trained volunteers displayed their insignia on arm bands and uniforms or civilian dress. An award winning painter, muralist and sculptor, Harold Lehman was known for making political statements with his artwork. He was born and raised in New York City, but moved to Los Angeles as a teenager, attending the Otis Art Institute. While in L.A. he worked with Phil Guston, Jackson Pollock, D.A. Siqueiros, and Manuel Tolegain. In 1941 Harold moved back to New York and continued his career, working with the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and the Federal Art Project, both New Deal programs to employ artists. He also worked with the Treasury department and Abbott Laboratories to create War Bond advertisements, pro-American propaganda, and anti-fascist pieces.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Framed oil painting created by David Friedmann (from 1960, Friedman) in 1947, depicting a scene in the Łódź Ghetto, where he was incarcerated from October 1941 until his deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in late August 1944. Artist's caption: ""Hungry families on the streets of Łódźer Ghetto were not an unusual, but an every day sight.""David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while writing for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1930–1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Illustration drawn by 24 year old Edward Herzbaum in Italy in 1944 of a memorable encounter he had when he was an inmate in a Soviet forced labor camp in 1941. The drawing depicts the hydroelectric plant in Szeksna (now Rybinsk, Russia) where Edward worked on a boat pump. He often went to the pier to swim. This day, August 27, 1941, he watched unseen as a young female laborer washed herself, then cried briefly, before noticing and reacting to his presence. See 2012.471.74 and.75 for other versions. It was drawn in 1943-1944 when his unit, the 2nd Polish Corps, was training with the British Army in the Middle East. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. They fought their way north and were in Italy in May 1945 when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He resumed the study of architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then worked for two years with the Polish Resettlement Corps and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Mixed media painting created by Arie Singer memorializing the day, July 17, 1941, that his father, Zvi, was taken and shot in the Ponary forest. It depicts Arie’s father, Zvi, standing with a group of men wearing Star of David badges in front of a red brick building with soldiers pointing pistols at them. Arie and his mother can be seen at a window; the Singer family lived in the red brick building next to a synagogue. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Jacob J. Barosin,"Drawing depicting Jacob Barosin’s experiences while interned or living in hiding in southern France from June 1940 to August 1943. In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, France, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp.

On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ava K. Schieber,"Pencil drawings of a foot and two hands done by Ava Hegedish, at the farm where she lived in hiding from spring 1941 to October 1944 near Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia.) In April 1941, Nazi Germany and its Axis partners partitioned Yugoslavia. Belgrade was under German control. Ava's father Leo decided the family's best chance of survival was to separate and go into hiding. He returned to Novy Sad; her mother and her sister Susanna remained in Belgrade. Susanna's Greek Orthodox husband had Serbian relatives with a farm near Belgrade and they agreed to take in Ava, then 15. She did farm labor and lived in this shed. To avoid suspicion and because she did not speak the local Serbian dialect, Ava pretended to be deaf and mute. She sometimes got scraps of paper and made drawings to hold onto her sense of self and her memories of her family. The region was liberated in October 1944. Ava searched for family in Belgrade. She learned that her sister was killed and her father murdered in Auschwitz. She was reunited with her mother and they settled in Belgrade where Ava attended art school.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

Julius Isaacsohn,"Original design for a coat created by Julius Isaacsohn, a Jewish designer with his own garment making business in prewar Berlin, Germany. In 1938, Julius and his wife Gertrud, a dressmaker with her own business, had lost their livelihood because of the anti-Semitic policies of the Nazi regime. They sent their daughter Dorit, age 6, to Brussels, Belgium, in early 1939, to stay with Gertrud’s sister Anna Kaufman. Germany invaded Belgium in May 1940, and Gertrud and Julius had Dorit returned to them in 1941. Gertrud and Julius became forced laborers for the German government, working in a leather factory and lumber yard respectively. On February 27, 1943, the family had to separate in order to go into hiding. Julius and Dorit stayed with family friends and Julius’ nephew, Rolf Isaacsohn, in Berlin, while Gertrud began working as a traveling seamstress. In October 1943, Gertrud brought Dorit to live with her on a farm in Wilkersdorf. Shortly after, Julius, who was hiding with friends, was betrayed to the authorities by Rolf. On October 29, Julius was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center in German-occupied Poland, where he was killed. Gertrud and Dorit traveled around eastern Germany making dresses for private clients until January 1945, when they were liberated by Soviet forces in Wilkersdorf. Gertrud and Dorit immigrated to the United States in November 1949.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

G.A. Sydenham,"Painting on glass of Fagin, the devil-like Jewish character from the novel, Oliver Twist, written by Charles Dickens in 1837-8. The image is based on an 1888 illustration by Kyd (Joseph Clayton Clarke.) The characterization is antisemitic and exploits many negative stereotypes. Referred to as The Jew, Fagin is introduced as ""villainous and repulsive,"" with black nails and fanglike teeth. He is greedy and vicious, and kidnaps small children and trains them to be thieves. Dickens rationalized the issue, saying that if he had a character who was a fence, a dealer in stolen goods, he had to be a Jew because ""that class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew.""  Later adaptations of the novel tried to sidestep the complications of Fagin's ethnic identity, or make him more of a comic figure, but his stereotypical Jewish traits are central to his depiction. This painting on glass is one of the more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of antisemitic artifacts and visual materials.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Street scene of people with Star of David parches walking down the street. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

F. (Fiszl) Zber,"Colored pencil drawing by Fiszel Zber of a garden with flowers near a shed at Beaune-Le-Rolande internment camp in France where he was imprisoned from 1941-1942. Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940. After the June armistice, the Germans occupied the north and western regions. In 1941, the Germans began rounding up Jewish residents who were not born in France. Zber, an artist specializing in woodcuts, was born in Poland. He was arrested as a foreign born Jew in 1941 and interned in Beaune-le-Rolande. While there, he drew scenes of the camp and the daily activities of the inmates. In 1942, the Germans began to deport foreign born Jews to concentration camps in the east. Zber was deported to Auschwitz where he was killed, age 33, on Oct. 26, 1942.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Indian politician and supporter of independence Jawaharlal Nehru, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while he was the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1936-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Lili Andrieux,"Ink drawing of young adult male seated on a stool at Gurs internment camp, drawn by Lili Andrieux, a German Jewish internee. Lili created over 100 detailed drawings of people and daily life in the internment camps where she was held from May 1940 - September 1942 in France. Alençon was a collection center for transport to Camp de Gurs in Vichy France. After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. She was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. When she recovered, she escaped and, with the help of the resistance, lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Chinese Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Chiang Kai-shek, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while he was the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1936-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Watercolor painting by Arie Singer depicting 2 soldiers with Nazi insignia watching as a crowd of men, women, and children with Star of David badges walk through a street in the ghetto on their way to Ponary. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth in Vilna and the Glembokie ghetto in Poland and with the partisans in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland(Vilnius, Lithuania), and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, nine year old Arie and his family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Emeric M. Lazar,"Pencil drawing of a man sleeping on his side created by Emeric Lazar in 1941 while imprisoned in Drancy internment camp in Paris, France. Emeric had come to Paris from Budapest in 1928 to study music. He was the house composer at Le Casino de Paris when Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940. France surrendered in June and Paris became the seat of the German military occupation. Anti-Jewish measures were enacted and, in August, an internment camp for foreign Jews was established in Drancy, a northeastern suburb of Paris. Emeric was imprisoned there on August 21, 1941. The camp became a major transit center for the deportation of Jews. In the summer of 1942, the Germans systematically deported Jews from Drancy to killing centers in Poland. On July 10, 1942, Emeric obtained a copy of his French baptism certificate from the archives of the Archbishop of Paris. He was released from Drancy on February 22, 1943. The camp was staffed by French police until July 1, 1943, when the Germans took control of the camp. Emeric lived in hiding in Paris until the city was liberated by American troops on August 25, 1944. Emeric then worked in an American Red Cross nightclub where he met US Army Lieutenant Hedwiga Ferlin. She came to the club during the day to practice the piano. The couple married on October 20, 1945, and left for New York in August 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, France, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp.

On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Lili Andrieux,"Double-sided ink drawing of a realistic old woman on one side and 10 abstract portraits on the opposite side, drawn by Lili Andrieux, a German Jewish internee while detained in the Hotel Terminus du port in Marseilles, France. Lili created over 100 detailed drawings of people and daily life in the internment camps where she was held from May 1940 - September 1942 in France. Alençon was a collection center for transport to Camp de Gurs in Vichy, France. After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus waiting for a visa. Lili was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. After recovering, she escaped with the help of the resistance, and lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Tempera painting, mat, and frame created by David Friedmann (from 1960, Friedman) in 1946 of the water pump in the Łódź Ghetto where he did the family's washing in summer and winter. Friedmann was incarcerated in the Ghetto from October 1941 until his deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in late August 1944. It depicts two men in heavy clothing with Stars of David pumping water in a snow covered yard. David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Argentinian President Agustín Justo (1932-1938), created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while he was the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1936-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Charcoal drawing created by David Friedman (before 1960, Friedmann) in 1963, depicting a scene in the Łódź Ghetto, where he was incarcerated from October 1941 until his deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in late August 1944. It depicts people with Star of David badges begging on the street. Artist's caption: ""Despairing and hungry people on streets in Łódźer Ghetto was one of the frequent sights to be seen. Official statistics: From 110,798 inmates between 1940-1944, 43, 441 perished. In May 1941, 20,000 Jews were officially registered for TB. But there were many other diseases too.""David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

They march along a brick street past people standing at tables. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth in Vilna and the Glembokie ghetto in Poland and with the partisans in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland(Vilnius, Lithuania), and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, nine year old Arie and his family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s.

In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, France, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp. On June 2, Jacob was transported to Langlade, to serve as a prestataire. Sonia was released from Gurs and traveled to Nice. On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the camp. Hannah walked to the Czechoslovak border where she collapsed; her friends took her to a hospital where she was placed in a crib because she only weighed 70 pounds and they thought she was a child. Upon her release, she returned to Prague and learned that all her family members were murdered. Hannah emigrated to the United States on December 21, 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Lili Andrieux,"Drawing of a street scene by Lili Andrieux, a German Jewish internee at Hotel Terminus du Port, Marseille, France. Lili created over 100 detailed drawings of people and daily life in the internment camps where she was held from May 1940 - September 1942 in France. Alençon was a collection center for transport to Camp de Gurs in Vichy France. After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. She was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. When she recovered, she escaped and, with the help of the resistance, lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Goychman,"Watercolor still life painting of fruit and a pitcher created by artist David Goychman while he was a prisoner in Compiègne internment camp in 1941. The painting was acquired by George Waldman, who was held in Compiègne from December 1941 to July 1943. George, Betsy, and their teenage son, John, were American citizens who lived in Paris to manage their paper import-export business. In response to the German invasion of Poland, France declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. In May of 1940, Germany invaded and quickly defeated France, occupying the northern half of the country. In 1941, the Germans began rounding up foreign born Jewish residents. Goychman, a native of the Soviet Union, was arrested in Paris in June 1941 and detained in Compiègne internment camp. In the camp he continued to paint and took part in an art exhibition held in the camp. On December 12, 1941, a day after Germany declared war on the United States, George Waldman was arrested and detained at Compiègne as an enemy alien and later joined his wife and son in Vittel internment camp. In 1942, the Germans began to systematically deport foreign born Jews to concentration camps in the east. On September 11, 1942, Goychman was transferred to Drancy internment and transit camp. Three days later, he was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center in German-occupied Poland under the name Leizer Goychman. Goychman was killed at Auschwitz on September 19, 1942. This may be the only known surviving Goychman painting from his time in the camp.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use.

Rollin Kirby,"Editorial cartoon, Torquemada, created by Rollin Kirby and probably published in the New York Post. The drawing portrays the isolationist US Senator Gerald Nye as a modern day Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor who cleansed Spain of Jews in the 15th century. In Kirby's portrayal, Nye, in judicial robes, is accusing a movie producer of hating Hitler. Nye chaired a committee in the 1930s that sought to tie US entry into World War I (1914-1918) to the influence of war profiteers. He was strongly opposed to US involvement in any foreign wars and was a drafter of the 1936 Neutrality Act forbidding arms shipments to any belligerent country. He won re-election in 1938 and was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he advocated non-intervention. He also formed the anti-war America First Committee. In 1941, he accused Hollywood of acting under the influence of Jews and communists and inciting war fever.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Prime Minister of Ireland Éamon de Valera, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while he was the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1936-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Woodcut by Alexander Bogen, depicting a German soldier menacing a Jewish woman and an elderly Jewish man. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania. Imprisoned in the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He joined the all-Jewish Nekhama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

It depicts a cloaked woman slumped against a wall with a horribly thin child in her lap. In December 1941, Hannah, her husband Karel Kohorn, and her family were deported from German-occupied Prague to Theresienstadt labor camp. Hannah had an abortion to avoid deportation to Poland. In September 1944, they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. That January, Hannah was transferred to Sackisch and then Merzdorf forced labor camps. On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the camp. Hannah walked to the Czechoslovak border where she collapsed; her friends took her to a hospital where she was placed in a crib because she only weighed 70 pounds and they thought she was a child. Upon her release, she returned to Prague and learned that all her family members were murdered. Hannah emigrated to the United States on December 21, 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Jacob J. Barosin,"Drawn by Jacob Barosin in early 1941 while he was in Langlade. It likely depicts a fellow prestataire, the name given to foreign laborers attached to the French army. In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May 1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp. On June 2, Jacob was transported to Langlade, to serve as a prestataire. Sonia was released from Gurs and traveled to Nice. On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Mixed media painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting a group of Jews, many with backpacks, being escorted by guards down a cobblestoned street; they are at an intersection and behind them on each side is a synagogue. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Lili Andrieux,"Drawing by Lili Andrieux, a German Jewish internee. Lili created over 100 detailed drawings of people and daily life in the internment camps where she was held from May 1940 - September 1942 in France. Alençon was a collection center for transport to Camp de Gurs in Vichy France. After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. She was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. When she recovered, she escaped and, with the help of the resistance, lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ava K. Schieber,"Oil painting of her paternal grandmother, Hermina Hirschel, painted by Ava Hegedish in 1941, when she lived in hiding from spring 1941 to October 1944 near Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia.) Ava also did a oil portrait of her, 2007.521.4. In April 1941, Nazi Germany and its Axis partners partitioned Yugoslavia. Belgrade was under German control. Ava's father Leo decided the family's best chance of survival was to separate and go into hiding. He returned to Novy Sad; her mother and her sister Susanna remained in Belgrade. Susanna's Greek Orthodox husband had Serbian relatives with a farm near Belgrade and they agreed to take in Ava, then 15. She did farm labor and lived in this shed. To avoid suspicion and because she did not speak the local Serbian dialect, Ava pretended to be deaf and mute.

Ava K. Schieber,"Ink drawing of large tree drawn by Ava Hegedish at the farm where she lived in hiding from spring 1941 to October 1944 near Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia.) In April 1941, Nazi Germany and its Axis partners partitioned Yugoslavia. Belgrade was under German control. Ava's father Leo decided the family's best chance of survival was to separate and go into hiding. He returned to Novy Sad; her mother and her sister Susanna remained in Belgrade. Susanna's Greek Orthodox husband had Serbian relatives with a farm near Belgrade and they agreed to take in Ava, then 15. She did farm labor and lived in this shed. To avoid suspicion and because she did not speak the local Serbian dialect, Ava pretended to be deaf and mute. She sometimes got scraps of paper and made drawings to hold onto her sense of self and her memories of her family. The region was liberated in October 1944. Ava searched for family in Belgrade. She learned that her sister was killed and her father murdered in Auschwitz.

David Friedman,"Charcoal drawing created by David Friedman (before 1960, Friedmann) in 1964, depicting a scene in the Łódź Ghetto, where he was incarcerated from October 1941 until his deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in late August 1944. Artist's caption: ""Newcomers in the Łódźer Ghetto pulling a carriage. In the background there is a Catholic church. At the time it was used for storage of bedfeathers taken by force from the Jews by the Nazis in that region. The wood bridge went to another part of the ghetto, and the street under the bridge was only for Germans. Watching soldiers were at every hundred feet.""David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Jacob J. Barosin,"Painting depicting Jacob Barosin’s experiences while interned or living in hiding in southern France from June 1940 to August 1943. In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, France, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp. On June 2, Jacob was transported to Langlade, to serve as a prestataire. Sonia was released from Gurs and traveled to Nice. On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while writing for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1930-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Mixed media work by Arie Singer depicting a long line of children, men, and women with Judenstern being marched under guard into a gated compound. The group in the foreground face 2 men in uniforms with Nazi insignia; one of the men lectures. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth in the Glembokie and Vilna ghettos and later as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

It depicts a seated woman clasping two skeletal children. In December 1941, Hannah, her husband Karel Kohorn, and her family were deported from German-occupied Prague to Theresienstadt labor camp. Hannah had an abortion to avoid deportation to Poland. In September 1944, they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. That January, Hannah was transferred to Sackisch and then Merzdorf forced labor camps. On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the camp. Hannah walked to the Czechoslovak border where she collapsed; her friends took her to a hospital where she was placed in a crib because she only weighed 70 pounds and they thought she was a child. Upon her release, she returned to Prague and learned that all her family members were murdered. Hannah emigrated to the United States on December 21, 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Dina Gabos,"Grayscale painting created by Dina Pollak Gabos in 1977, commemorating her family’s escape from Yugoslavia to Italy in December 1941. The Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. Dina, age three, and her parents Otto and Rifka lived in Zagreb, which became part of Croatia and was ruled by the fascist anti-Semitic Ustasa regime. On April 28, Otto was sent by the Ustasa police to Kerestinec concentration camp, but was released in June. In October, the family fled to Italian controlled Ljubljana. They lived in hiding until they escaped to Italy in December 1941.

Jacob J. Barosin,"Drawing depicting Jacob Barosin’s experiences while interned or living in hiding in southern France from June 1940 to August 1943. In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, France, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp.

On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those suspected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on trial for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Illustration created by 24 year old Edward Herzbaum in Italy in 1944 of a memorable encounter he had when he was an inmate in a Soviet forced labor camp in 1941. The drawing depicts the hydroelectric plant in Szeksna (now Rybinsk, Russia) where Edward worked on a boat pump. He often went to the pier to swim. This day, August 27, 1941, he watched unseen as a young female laborer washed herself, then cried briefly, before noticing and reacting to his presence. See 2012.471.75 and.76 for other versions. It was drawn in 1943-1944 when his unit, the 2nd Polish Corps, was training with the British Army in the Middle East. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. They fought their way north and were in Italy in May 1945 when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He resumed the study of architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then worked for two years with the Polish Resettlement Corps and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maksim Litvinov, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while writing for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1930-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Lili Andrieux,"Drawing  by Lili Andrieux, a German Jewish internee. Lili created over 100 detailed drawings of people and daily life in the internment camps where she was held from May 1940 - September 1942 in France. Alençon was a collection center for transport to Camp de Gurs in Vichy France. After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. She was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. When she recovered, she escaped and, with the help of the resistance, lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Halina Olomucki,"Pencil drawing of a sick, emaciated boy selling Star of David armbands created by Halina Olszewski, 24, (later Olomucki) while interned in Warsaw Ghetto in 1941. Nazi Germany occupied Poland in September 1939, and, in fall 1940, Halina, her mother Margarit-Hadassa, and siblings were relocated to the ghetto. Halina did forced labor, but she felt her real job was to record the misery and suffering of ghetto residents. Halina smuggled many drawings to a non-Jewish friend outside the ghetto. In May 1943, she and her mother were deported to Majdanek where her mother was killed on arrival. In July, Halina was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she continued to create art in secret. Other prisoners asked her to draw them or their loved ones, to preserve their memory and show the world what happened. She hid artwork in the camp, much of it recovered postwar. On January 18, 1945, Halina was sent by death march to Ravensbrück and Neustadt-Glewe, where she was liberated on May 2, 1945. She returned to Warsaw but found no surviving family members.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

Arie Singer,"Watercolor painting by Arie Singer of German soldiers shooting boys and men at a large blood streaked dirt pit in the forest. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth in Vilna and the Glembokie ghetto in Poland and with the partisans in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland(Vilnius, Lithuania), and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, nine year old Arie and his family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Charcoal drawing created by David Friedman (before 1960, Friedmann) in 1964, depicting a scene in the Łódź Ghetto, where he was incarcerated from October 1941 until his deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in late August 1944. It depicts a worn and exhausted woman with two children; all wearing Judenstern. Artist's caption: ""Mother with two children in Łódźer Ghetto (Litzmannstadt). Her husband was working in a German factory."" David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945.He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, France, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp. On June 2, Jacob was transported to Langlade, to serve as a prestataire. Sonia was released from Gurs and traveled to Nice. On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ava K. Schieber,"Watercolor of sailboats on the Danube River painted by Ava Hegedish in 1941, just before or while living in hiding near Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The painting depicts the ships filled with Jewish refugees from Austria, Germany, and Czechoslovakia that she saw anchored in the middle of the river in the late 1930s-early 1940s. They were not permitted to enter port and were forced to continue their journey to the Black Sea where Ava believed they perished. She thought of them as ghost ships. The Jewish community sent food and clothing to the ships, and sometimes the students who delivered the supplies were not allowed to return to Belgrade. In April 1941, Germany and the Axis partners partitioned Yugoslavia. Belgrade was under German control. Ava's father Leo decided the family's best chance of survival was to separate and go into hiding. He returned to Novy Sad. Ava's mother Beatrice and Ava's older sister Susanna remained in Belgrade. Susanna's Greek Orthodox husband had Serbian relatives with a farm near Belgrade and they agreed to take in Ava, then 15. She did farm labor and, to avoid suspicion and because she did not speak the local Serbian dialect, pretend to be deaf and mute. Ava sometimes got scraps of paper and made drawings to hold onto her sense of self and her memories of her family. The region was liberated in October 1944. Ava searched for family  and learned that her sister was killed and her father and his mother were murdered in Auschwitz. She was reunited with her mother and they settled in Belgrade where Ava attended art  school.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. She was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. When she recovered, she escaped and, with the help of the resistance, lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France.

After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. Lili was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. After recovering, she escaped with the help of the resistance, and lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Albert E. Carter,"Political cartoon depicting former Japanese Prime Minister and the nation’s last elder statesman, Prince Saionji Kinmochi, created by American journalist Albert E. Carter while he was the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press in Tennessee, from 1936-1943. He often punctuated his articles with cartoons depicting global news and international leaders. Albert, a college senior, was working as a reporter for the Chattanooga Times when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. During the mid-1930s, Germany followed a revisionist policy aimed at overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). These policy changes prompted foreign scholars, government officials, and reporters, like Albert, to make their way to Germany to document events. For much of 1934, Albert traveled around Germany by bike while recording his experiences. In 1936, Albert became the Sunday editor and foreign affairs columnist for the paper. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan frequently made international headlines in the second half of the 1930s, and all had leaders represented in Albert’s cartoons. Spurred by a growing interest in South America’s relationship to the US and events in Europe that led up to the war, Albert visited all the nations of South America as a reporter and researcher from 1940 into 1941. Albert returned to the US early in 1941, where he published “The Battle for South America” later that year. In 1943, Albert became a Foreign Service Officer serving in Central and South America for the U.S. State Department. In 1946, Albert married Dorothy Sharp Carter, an American school teacher, in Costa Rica. Dorothy and their four children accompanied Albert while he was posted at embassies throughout his career, including Uruguay, Panama, Paraguay, and Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

A newspaper man saw the scene above in 1933, and told me about it. The dress clothes cannot hide the brutality of the headsman and his assistants, who are about to execute a man whose crime was that he objected to tyranny.

Lili Andrieux,"Ink wash drawing of two women sitting on stools in Gurs internment camp, drawn by Lili Andrieux, a German Jewish internee. Lili created over 100 detailed drawings of people and daily life in the internment camps where she was held from May 1940 - September 1942 in France. Alençon was a collection center for transport to Camp de Gurs in Vichy France. After surrendering to Nazi Germany in June 1940, France was divided into two zones: a German military occupation zone and Free France under the Vichy regime. Gurs, built in spring 1939 to hold refugees from Spain, became an internment center for Jewish refugees. Lili, originally from Berlin, moved to Paris in 1938. She was taken to Alençon in May 1940 and reached Gurs on June 4. From March 1941-September 1942, she was held in the Hotel Terminus in Marseilles waiting for a visa. She was then sent to Les Milles internment camp where she became ill with typhus. When she recovered, she escaped and, with the help of the resistance, lived in hiding until fall 1944, when the war ended in France. Lili was a translator for the US Army and US Graves Registration Command until immigrating to America in September 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Pencil portrait of his father Ernst with pipe and beret owned by Fred Vendig. It was done by an unknown inmate when Ernst was imprisoned at Gurs internment camp in France in 1940. A few years after the Nazi dictatorship took power in Germany in 1933, Ernst's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. On May 13, 1939,  Ernst, wife Charlotte, and sons Fritz, 7, and Heiner, 2, and his mother Pauline sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland got them smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. The family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Pen and ink drawing created by David Friedmann (from 1960, Friedman) in 1942, when he was incarcerated in the Łódź Ghetto in German-occupied Poland. The work depicts a trio of men called fecalists whose job was to haul away bodily waste. The Ghetto had no running water or sewers. Friedmann gave the drawing to Menachem Rubinstein with a personalized label in July 1950 in Tel Aviv, Israel. The men befriended each other when both were forced to live in the sealed Ghetto, set up by the Germans in February 1940. Rubinstein's three year old son, Dawid, died there in 1943. His wife, Hadasa, also perished. Rubinstein was imprisoned to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Gleiwitz I, and Blechhammer and freed during a death march on January 25, 1945. He returned to Łódź after the war ended in May 1945. In 1946, he left for France, and then emigrated to Israel. David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Edward H. Hartry,"Watercolor of three packed camels with a cloaked rider created by 22 year old Edward Herzbaum in March 1942. Edward had recently joined the Polish Armed Forces of the East, later the 2nd Polish Corps, now in Kyrgyzstan, following his release from a Soviet labor camp. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, he was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the new voluntary army, known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps, British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for heroism in the 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on VE Day, May 8, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alona Frankel,"Pencil and pastel drawing of a puss in boots, a dog with a suitcase, and a family with farm tools created by 6 year old Ilona Goldman while living in hiding in Poland from 1942-1944. See 2009.204.24 for a less polished version of this scene. In spring 1942, Ilona was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide Ilona for a fee. Drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. Many drawings were done on the weekly letters Hania sent to Ilona's parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ilona and her parents, Salomon and Gusta, fled Krakow for Soviet controlled Lvov (Lviv, Ukraine). When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was forced into the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a meat factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak. However, he would not hide Ilona because it would be too hard to conceal a lively 4 year-old. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with Hania. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s.

It depicts a newly arrived transport of prisoners waiting at the ghetto gate. Haas was an inmate of Terezin from September 1942-October 1944. Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the misery and suffering of daily life in the ghetto. They hid their work in the camp, and much was recovered postwar. In summer 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp and were arrested and tortured. In October, Haas was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by American troops.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

In April 1941, Nazi Germany and its Axis partners partitioned Yugoslavia. Belgrade was under German control. Ava's father Leo decided the family's best chance of survival was to separate and go into hiding. He returned to Novy Sad; her mother and her sister Susanna remained in Belgrade. Susanna's Greek Orthodox husband had Serbian relatives with a farm near Belgrade and they agreed to take in Ava, then 15. She did farm labor and lived in this shed. To avoid suspicion and because she did not speak the local Serbian dialect, Ava pretended to be deaf and mute.

She learned that her sister was killed and her father murdered in Auschwitz.

Arie Singer,"Watercolor painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting a man and women with Star of David badges being confronted by two German guards inside a vegetable hothouse in the ghetto in Glembokie, Poland (Hlybokaye (Belarus). It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie. When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alona Frankel,"Pencil sketch of a farming family with a partial view of a puss in boots, a dog with a suitcase, and a girl created by 6 year old Ilona Goldman perhaps around 1944. See 2009.204.25 for a more detailed version of this scene. In spring 1942, Ilona was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide Ilona for a fee. Drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. Many drawings were done on the weekly letters Hania sent to Ilona's parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ilona and her parents, Salomon and Gusta, fled Krakow for  Soviet controlled Lvov (Lviv, Ukraine). When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was forced into the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a meat factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak. However, he would not hide Ilona because it would be too hard to conceal a lively 4 year-old. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with Hania. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Watercolor of three dark green mountain ranges against a light blue sky painted by 22 year old Edward Herzbaum in August 1942 in Khanaqin, Iraq. Edward had traveled south with the Polish Armed Forces of the East, later the 2nd Polish Corps, from the Soviet Union to British territory in Iraq. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He joined the Polish Army of the East, a newly formed volunteer Polish force known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for heroism in the 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946.

Louise Starr,"Mystical oil painting created by Louise Abouaf Starr in 2003 to commemorate March 27, 1942, the day she witnessed the first deportation of Jewish prisoners from Drancy via train from Paris. The colorful painting features train cars loaded with prisoners surrounded by symbolic images of angels, animals, and the Torah. On March 27, Louise, age 23, and her mother went to the station looking for her father and brother. They were warned not to go onto the platform, since German soldiers threatened to shoot unauthorized persons. They bought a ticket and snuck onto quay one and hid under a corner overhang. They saw soldiers force about 100 Jewish prisoners toward the trains; three car were already closed and they could hear the occupants yelling. They did not see Marcel or Maurice. Louise saw a hand reach out of a car and drop a paper. She ran over to get it, but was seen by soldiers who moved toward her. An engineer, Jean-Louis Loiret, operating a train on another track, stopped so the women could jump aboard. In 1949, they learned that her brother Marcel was deported that day. France was invaded by Nazi Germany on May 10, 1940, and surrendered on June 22. Louise, her parents Maurice and Djoya, and four younger siblings lived in Paris which was under German military governance. Anti-Jewish measures were enacted and, in August 1940, an internment camp for foreign Jews was established in Drancy, a northeastern suburb of Paris. The family, originally from Turkey, had lived in France since 1923, but in April 1941, Maurice and Marcel were interned at Drancy. On March 26, 1942, the family received a letter from Maurice telling them prisoners were being moved the next day. Louise and Djoya went to the station to see if their loved ones were there. They did not know that the trains were going to Auschwitz or that Marcel was on that transport. Maurice was deported on June 22. Both men were killed in Auschwitz in July 1942. The rest of the family went into hiding, first at a neighbor’s home, then in their apartment building. When Paris was liberated on August 25, 1944, Louise met Charles Starr, an American soldier. They married on December 16, 1944. After the war, Louise became an artist under the name Lounah Starr.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Jacob J. Barosin,"Watercolor painting depicting three girls, completed by Jacob Barosin in 1942. It was likely completed in the spring near the town of Lunel, where Jacob lived and worked on a nearby farm until German forces occupied the area in November 1942. In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May 1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp. On June 2, Jacob was transported to Langlade, to serve as a prestataire. Sonia was released from Gurs and traveled to Nice. On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Jacques Gotko,"Linocut print of a yard in the Compiègne internment camp in German-occupied France created by artist Jacques Gotko in 1942. The print was acquired by George Waldman, who was held in Compiègne from December 1941 to July 1943. George, Betsy, and their teenage son, John, were American citizens who lived in Paris to manage their paper import-export business. In response to the German invasion of Poland, France declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. In May of 1940, Germany invaded and quickly defeated France, occupying the northern half of the country. In 1941, the Germans began rounding up foreign born Jewish residents. Gotko, a native of the Soviet Union, was arrested in Paris in July 1941 and detained in Compiègne internment camp. In the camp Gotko painted watercolors, drew pencil sketches, and created linocuts of life in the camp and sent his earnings from portrait commissions to his wife. On December 12, 1941, a day after Germany declared war on the United States, George Waldman was arrested and detained at Compiègne as an enemy alien and later joined his wife and son in Vittel internment camp. In 1942, the Germans began to deport foreign born Jews to concentration camps in the east. In September, Gotko was transferred to Drancy internment and transit camp where he was reunited with his mother and sister. In November, his mother and sister were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. On July 18, 1943, Gotko was deported to Auschwitz, given prisoner number 130612, and was selected for forced labor. Gotko died of typhus on January 2, 1944, in Auschwitz.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum does not own copyright to this material.

Halina Olomucki,"Drawing depicting Janusz Korczak and children being taken from Warsaw Ghetto created by Halina Olszewski, 24, (later Olomucki) in the ghetto in 1943. Germany occupied Poland in September 1939, and established the ghetto in October 1940. Dr. Korczak ran a Jewish orphanage in the ghetto. In July 1942, the Germans began mass deportations to Treblinka killing center. Korczak was offered a chance to escape, but refused to abandon the children. On August 6, Korczak led his staff and about 200 children in an orderly walk to the deportation train. Halina, her mother Margarit-Hadassa, and siblings were relocated to the ghetto in 1940. Halina did forced labor, but she felt her real job was to record the misery and suffering of ghetto residents. Halina smuggled drawings to a non-Jewish friend outside the ghetto. In May 1943, she and her mother were deported to Majdanek where her mother was killed on arrival. In July, Halina was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she continued to create art in secret. Other prisoners asked her to draw them or their loved ones to preserve their memory and show the world what happened. She hid artwork in the camp, much of it recovered postwar. On January 18, 1945, Halina was sent by death march to Ravensbrück and Neustadt-Glewe, where she was liberated on May 2, 1945. She returned to Warsaw but found no surviving family members.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

Meir Baum,"Drawing created by 15-year-old Otto (Meir) Baum depicitng the Chateau Montintin, a home for refugee children where Otto and his 16-year-old brother, Bernhard (Issachar Ilan), were placed in early 1943. Montinin was run by the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE), [Children’s Aid Society], which was able to get the boys released from Les Milles internment camp in France because they were not yet 16. The Baum family, Erna and Leo, and their 2 sons, had been imprisoned because they were Jewish refugees from Germany.  Before OSE would take custody of the boys, their parents had to give up all parental rights. The boys said their goodbyes and boarded a bus; it was the last time they would see their parents. Both Erna and Leo died in Auschwitz concentration camp. Bernhard became quite ill and was hidden with a peasant family for a while, though he later returned to Montintin. Otto was sent first to Majolier, then, in late 1943, was smuggled to Switzerland, where he had an aunt. Bernhard had to keep moving from place to place, but in April 1944, he managed to cross the border to safety in Switzerland. An uncle would find both boys after the war and offer to take them to the United States. However, in honor of their parents, who had been dedicated Zionists, they chose to emigrate to Palestine in September 1945.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alona Frankel,"Pencil and pastel drawing of a girl, animals, and a train created by 6 year old Ilona Goldman while living in hiding in Poland from 1942-1944. In spring 1942, Ilona was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide Ilona for a fee. Drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. Many drawings were done on the weekly letters Hania sent to Ilona's parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ilona and her parents, Salomon and Gusta, fled Krakow for Soviet controlled Lvov (Lviv, Ukraine). When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was forced into the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a meat factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak. However, he would not hide Ilona because it would be too hard to conceal a lively 4 year-old. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with Hania. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Watercolor and marker drawing by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting himself as a young boy, with a woman and a man in winter coats and hats with yellow Star of David badges taking care of flower beds near the hothouses in the Glembokie, Poland (Hlybokaye (Belarus) ghetto in March 1942. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Watercolor by Arie Singer depicting himself and his mother? at a window: in the right, 2 panels of the mass shooting of Jews by German soldiers. It was part of a series by Singer, done circa 1985-2000, based upon his memories as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests near Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and Belarus circa 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded in June 1941, German mobile killing units, with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the Ponary massacres in 1941. Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped during liquidation of the ghetto. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, and joined the partisans. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After years in dp camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Watercolor of a brown British military transport on yellow sand created by Edward Herzbaum in Iraq circa 1943 where the 2nd Polish Corps was training with the British Army. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq. They journeyed to Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital. Many died there after the long, arduous march from Russia. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward was in the 5th Kresowa Infantry Division, 2nd Polish Corps. At age 19, he left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied it in September 1939 for Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released in an amnesty of Polish prisoners and joined the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in Italy. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for bravery at Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

The style is similar to 2012.471.32, painted in May, suggesting a view of the same mountains from different sides of the border. Edward had traveled south with the Polish Armed Forces of the East, later the 2nd Polish Corps, from the Soviet Union to British territory in Iraq. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He joined the Polish Army of the East, a newly formed volunteer Polish force known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign.

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen, depicting a street scene in the ghetto in Vilna, Lithuania. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Small line drawing in ink of a young woman and a mustached man created by 23 year old Edward Herzbaum circa 1943. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south in 1941-1942 from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq. They journeyed to the border town of Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital where many died after the long, arduous march from Russia. There were oil fields near the city and it was also along a major Muslim pilgrimage route. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939. He went to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Watercolor by Leo Haas of a group of blind inmates with Judenstern walking outdoors. It is based on scenes he witnessed in 1942 while an inmate of Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp. Haas was an inmate of Terezin from September 1942-October 1944. Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the misery and suffering of daily life in the ghetto. They hid their work in the camp, and much was recovered postwar. In summer 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp and were arrested and tortured. In October, Haas was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by American troops.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Watercolor by Arie Singer depicting German soldiers using a short wave radio at night in the forest. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ann Naijon,"Watercolor painting of the line for wood and coal at Hotel Central in Vittel internment camp in German-occupied France, originally owned by Gertrude Hamilton and eventually given to Leonie Roualet. Gertrude and Leonie became friends while interned together in Vittel. Both women were from the United States, but were living in France when Germany invaded in May 1940. Leonie was taking care of ailing relatives, while Gertrude worked as an ambulance driver for the American Hospital in Paris. In July 1941, Gertrude started working for the bureau for civilians set up by the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association), where she took care of civilians released from prison camps. On September 24, 1942, the Gestapo arrested Leonie as an enemy alien and sent her to a prison in Châlons. From there she was transferred to Frontstalag 194 in Vittel. She remained there for two years until the camp was liberated by Free French forces on September 12, 1944. Gertrude was also arrested in September 1942, and she lived in Vittel for two months before the YMCA secured permission for her release from the Germans. She was arrested again in September 1943, and sent back to Vittel for another six months. Following the liberation of Paris, Gertrude continued her work with the YMCA helping civilians released from prison camps, while Leonie worked for the Red Cross and helped establish the first displaced persons (DP) camp in Paris.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Pencil drawing of a horned bull created by 23 year old Edward Herzbaum circa 1943. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south in 1941-1942 from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq. They journeyed to the border town of Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital where many died after the long, arduous march from Russia. There were oil fields near the city and it was also along a major Muslim pilgrimage route. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939. He went to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Woodblock designed by Alexander Bogen for printing a scene of a German officer menacing a group of Jews, and on the back, two soldiers sitting in the forest. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Emeric had come to Paris from Budapest in 1928 to study music. He was the house composer at Le Casino de Paris when Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940.

Anti-Jewish measures were enacted and, in August, an internment camp for foreign Jews was established in Drancy, a northeastern suburb of Paris. Emeric was imprisoned there on August 21, 1941. The camp became a major transit center for the deportation of Jews. In the summer of 1942, the Germans systematically deported Jews from Drancy to killing centers in Poland. On July 10, 1942, Emeric obtained a copy of his French baptism certificate from the archives of the Archbishop of Paris.  He was released from Drancy on February 22, 1943.

Ann Naijon,"Watercolor painting of a woman in Vittel internment camp in German-occupied France, originally owned by Gertrude Hamilton and eventually given to Leonie Roualet. Gertrude and Leonie became friends while interned together in Vittel. Both women were from the United States, but were living in France when Germany invaded in May 1940. Leonie was taking care of ailing relatives, while Gertrude worked as an ambulance driver for the American Hospital in Paris. In July 1941, Gertrude started working for the bureau for civilians set up by the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association), where she took care of civilians released from prison camps. On September 24, 1942, the Gestapo arrested Leonie as an enemy alien and sent her to a prison in Châlons. From there she was transferred to Frontstalag 194 in Vittel. She remained there for two years until the camp was liberated by Free French forces on September 12, 1944. Gertrude was also arrested in September 1942, and she lived in Vittel for two months before the YMCA secured permission for her release from the Germans. She was arrested again in September 1943, and sent back to Vittel for another six months. Following the liberation of Paris, Gertrude continued her work with the YMCA helping civilians released from prison camps, while Leonie worked for the Red Cross and helped establish the first displaced persons (DP) camp in Paris.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Watercolor painting of an oil refinery in the desert created by 23 year old Edward Herzbaum in March 1943 in Kanaqin (Khanaqin), Iraq. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq as the Polish 2nd Corps. They journeyed to the border town of Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital where many died after the long, arduous march from Russia. There were oil fields near the city and it was also along a major Muslim pilgrimage route. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 for Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released in an amnesty of Polish prisoners and joined Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in Italy. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen, depicting a man wearing a six-pointed star. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting a group of partisans detonating an explosion in the path of a German train. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. In spring 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Emeric M. Lazar,"Pencil drawing of an old man with a weathered face created by Emeric Lazar in February 1943 while imprisoned in Drancy internment camp in Paris, France. Emeric had come to Paris from Budapest in 1928 to study music. He was the house composer at Le Casino de Paris when Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940. France surrendered in June and Paris became the seat of the German military occupation. Anti-Jewish measures were enacted and, in August, an internment camp for foreign Jews was established in Drancy, a northeastern suburb of Paris. Emeric was imprisoned there on August 21, 1941. The camp became a major transit center for the deportation of Jews. In the summer of 1942, the Germans systematically deported Jews from Drancy to killing centers in Poland. On July 10, 1942, Emeric obtained a copy of his French baptism certificate from the archives of the Archbishop of Paris. He was released from Drancy on February 22, 1943. The camp was staffed by French police until July 1, 1943, when the Germans took control of the camp. Emeric lived in hiding in Paris until the city was liberated by American troops on August 25, 1944. Emeric then worked in an American Red Cross nightclub where he met US Army Lieutenant Hedwiga Ferlin. She came to the club during the day to practice the piano. The couple married on October 20, 1945, and left for New York in August 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting a group of partisans eating and cleaning rifles inside their underground cabin in the forest. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Peter Kien,"Caricature drawn by Peter Kien for Moritz Henschel while both were imprisoned in Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp. It depicts Moritz as a circus ringmaster. Moritz was a member of the Jewish Council in the camp and Kien was an influential artist and playwright who also designed the camp currency. Kien was deported to Auschwitz in October 1944 and died soon after arrival. Moritz was an influential lawyer in Berlin when Hitler came to power in Germany in January 1933. As the government persecution of Jews intensified, Moritz and Hildegard sent their daughters Marianne, 15, to Palestine and Lilly, 13, to England in 1939. Moritz was on the board of the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, created by the Nazi government in February 1939 to organize Jewish affairs. The Association was eventually forced to assist with deportations. Moritz also became president of the Berlin Jewish Community. In January 1943, Moritz became president of the Reich Association, when Leo Baeck was deported. On June 10, 1943, the Reich Association was shut down and Moritz and Hildegard were deported to Theresienstadt on June 16. Moritz was elected to the Jewish Council and put in charge of the Freizeitgestaltung, which produced cultural materials and events. On May 9, 1945, the camp was liberated by Soviet forces.

Emeric M. Lazar,"Portrait drawing of a young man in a cap created by Emeric Lazar in January 1943 while imprisoned in Drancy internment camp in Paris, France. Emeric had come to Paris from Budapest in 1928 to study music. He was the house composer at Le Casino de Paris when Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940. France surrendered in June and Paris became the seat of the German military occupation. Anti-Jewish measures were enacted and, in August, an internment camp for foreign Jews was established in Drancy, a northeastern suburb of Paris. Emeric was imprisoned there on August 21, 1941. The camp became a major transit center for the deportation of Jews. In the summer of 1942, the Germans systematically deported Jews from Drancy to killing centers in Poland. On July 10, 1942, Emeric obtained a copy of his French baptism certificate from the archives of the Archbishop of Paris. He was released from Drancy on February 22, 1943. The camp was staffed by French police until July 1, 1943, when the Germans took control of the camp. Emeric lived in hiding in Paris until the city was liberated by American troops on August 25, 1944. Emeric then worked in an American Red Cross nightclub where he met US Army Lieutenant Hedwiga Ferlin. She came to the club during the day to practice the piano. The couple married on October 20, 1945, and left for New York in August 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Small pencilled line drawing of a man in uniform and a woman dancing created by Edward Herzbaum circa 1943-1944. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south in 1941-1942 from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq. They journeyed to the border town of Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital where many died after the long, arduous march from Russia. There were oil fields near the city and it was also along a major Muslim pilgrimage route. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939. He went to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen while he was a partisan fighter in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia during World War II. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Watercolor by Arie Singer depicting himself and his cousin Edith watching out a window as German police shoot a youth with a bandaged head in the back in the Glembokie Ghetto. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen while he was a partisan fighter in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia during World War II. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Self portrait pencil sketch created by 24 year old Edward Herzbaum circa 1943-1944 when, as a soldier in the 5th Kresowa, 2nd Polish Corps, he was training with the British Army in the Middle East. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south in 1941-1942 from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq. They journeyed to the border town of Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital where many died after the long, arduous march from Russia. There were oil fields near the city and it was also along a major Muslim pilgrimage route. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939. He went to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen, depicting a German soldier rounding up a group of Jews in the ghetto of Vilna, Lithuania. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Myra Strauss Rutenberg,"Portrait drawing of Moritz Henschel by Myra Strauss Rutenberg given to Moritz while he and his wife Hildegard were imprisoned in Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp from June 1943-May 1945. Moritz was an influential lawyer in Berlin when Hitler came to power in Germany in January 1933. As government persecution of Jews intensified, Moritz and Hildegard sent their daughters Marianne, 15, to Palestine and Lilly, 13, to England in 1939. Moritz was on the board of the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, created by the Nazi government in February 1939 to organize Jewish affairs. The Association was eventually forced to assist with deportations. In 1940, Moritz became president of the Berlin Jewish Community. In January 1943, Moritz became president of the Reich Association, when Leo Baeck was deported. On June 10, 1943, the Reich Association was shut down and Moritz and Hildegard were deported to Theresienstadt. Moritz was elected to the Jewish Council and put in charge of the Freizeitgestaltung, which produced cultural events and materials. On May 9, 1945, the camp was liberated by Soviet forces. Moritz and Hildegard went to Deggendorf displaced persons camp, then emigrated to Palestine in 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Portrait sketch of a young man created by 23 year old Edward Herzbaum in January 1943 in Iraq. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq. They journeyed to Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital where many died after the long, arduous march from Russia. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939. He went to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

In September 1939, Nazi Germany occupied Poland. The family was imprisoned in Ostrow Lubelski and Stare Zalucze ghettos. In 1942, Irena found a one room house in Zalasocze where she fled with their five children. Isidor, who was Jewish, created a hiding place just for himself. Irena was Catholic and did not hide and they got false papers for the children and, at least part of the time, sent them to stay with Irena's mother. In mid-1942, Irena took in two young Jewish girls: Masza Zunszajn, 8, and Roza Zaltz, 17. She was honored by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among Nations in 1985.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ann Naijon,"Watercolor painting of women receiving Red Cross packages at Vittel internment camp in German-occupied France, originally owned by Gertrude Hamilton and eventually given to Leonie Roualet. Gertrude and Leonie became friends while interned together in Vittel. Both women were from the United States, but were living in France when Germany invaded in May 1940. Leonie was taking care of ailing relatives, while Gertrude worked as an ambulance driver for the American Hospital in Paris. In July 1941, Gertrude started working for the bureau for civilians set up by the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association), where she took care of civilians released from prison camps. On September 24, 1942, the Gestapo arrested Leonie as an enemy alien and sent her to a prison in Châlons. From there she was transferred to Frontstalag 194 in Vittel. She remained there for two years until the camp was liberated by Free French forces on September 12, 1944. Gertrude was also arrested in September 1942, and she lived in Vittel for two months before the YMCA secured permission for her release from the Germans. She was arrested again in September 1943, and sent back to Vittel for another six months. Following the liberation of Paris, Gertrude continued her work with the YMCA helping civilians released from prison camps, while Leonie worked for the Red Cross and helped establish the first displaced persons (DP) camp in Paris.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen, depicting two Jews interned in the ghetto of Vilna, Lithuania. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Jacob J. Barosin,"Unfinished watercolor depicting the mountain village of Florac, painted by Jacob Barosin on February 16, 1943. He had intended to return and finish it, but Jacob was arrested the following morning and transported to Gurs internment camp.  In June 1933, Jacob and Sonia Barosin (previously Judey) immigrated illegally to Paris, in order to escape the anti-Jewish laws passed following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany in January. Jacob voluntarily enlisted in the French military following the 1939 German invasion of Poland. In May 1940, Germany invaded France, Jacob and Sonia were arrested as enemy aliens, and Sonia was transported to Gurs internment camp. On June 2, Jacob was transported to Langlade, to serve as a prestataire. Sonia was released from Gurs and traveled to Nice. On May 15, 1941, Jacob was released and moved to Lunel, where Sonia joined him in April 1942. In mid-October, Jacob was sent to Agde internment camp. A friend of his father worked in the camp office and arranged for him to return to Lunel. German forces occupied Lunel in November, so Jacob and Sonia fled to Florac. On February 17, 1943, Jacob was arrested and transported to Gurs, and then sent to a labor camp in Gignac on March 21. Jacob returned to Florac on April 17, and teacher Simone Serriere hid Jacob and Sonia in her schoolhouse in Montmejean. After they were discovered by townspeople, Sonia’s cousins, Boris and Paulette, brought them forged identity papers, and they all returned to Paris in September. Jacob and Sonia were given refuge by Paulette’s mother, until Paris was liberated in late August 1944. The majority of Jacob’s family survived, though his Latvian relatives and his sister, Sina Ida, were murdered during the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting a mixed group of partisans and soldiers, possibly Soviet, walking through the forest. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Portrait of four adult male forced laborers by Leo Haas, based upon scenes he witnessed as a German prisoner in several camps. This is likely a scene from Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp and each man is portrayed as a recognizable individual. Leo Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist Party member. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the conditions of daily life in the camp. In summer of 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp. Haas was arrested and tortured. In October, he was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by US troops.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ann Naijon,"Watercolor painting of the package line in Vittel internment camp in German-occupied France, originally owned by Gertrude Hamilton and eventually given to Leonie Roualet. Gertrude and Leonie became friends while interned together in Vittel. Both women were from the United States, but were living in France when Germany invaded in May 1940. Leonie was taking care of ailing relatives, while Gertrude worked as an ambulance driver for the American Hospital in Paris. In July 1941, Gertrude started working for the bureau for civilians set up by the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association), where she took care of civilians released from prison camps. On September 24, 1942, the Gestapo arrested Leonie as an enemy alien and sent her to a prison in Châlons. From there she was transferred to Frontstalag 194 in Vittel. She remained there for two years until the camp was liberated by Free French forces on September 12, 1944. Gertrude was also arrested in September 1942, and she lived in Vittel for two months before the YMCA secured permission for her release from the Germans. She was arrested again in September 1943, and sent back to Vittel for another six months. Following the liberation of Paris, Gertrude continued her work with the YMCA helping civilians released from prison camps, while Leonie worked for the Red Cross and helped establish the first displaced persons (DP) camp in Paris.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Aquatint created by Leo Haas in 1966 based upon sketches made in 1943 of scenes he witnessed while an inmate of Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp. It depicts a lone soldier on guard in a deserted street watching prisoners leave the camp in the distance. Haas was an inmate of Terezin from September 1942-October 1944. Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the misery and suffering of daily life in the ghetto. They hid their work in the camp, and much was recovered postwar. In summer 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp and were arrested and tortured. In October, Haas was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by American troops.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Tempera is a paint medium of dry pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder, such as egg yolk. This piece likely depicts the aftermath of Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. An award winning painter, muralist and sculptor, Harold Lehman was known for making political statements with his artwork. He was born and raised in New York City, but moved to Los Angeles as a teenager, attending the Otis Art Institute. While in L.A. he worked with Phil Guston, Jackson Pollock, D.A. Siqueiros, and Manuel Tolegain. In 1941, Harold moved back to New York and continued his career, working with the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and the Federal Art Project, both New Deal programs to employ artists. He also worked with the Treasury department and Abbott Laboratories to create War Bond advertisements, pro-American propaganda, and anti-fascist pieces.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Ann Naijon,"Watercolor painting of the dining room during lunch at Vittel internment camp in German-occupied France, originally owned by Gertrude Hamilton and eventually given to Leonie Roualet. Gertrude and Leonie became friends while interned together in Vittel. Both women were from the United States, but were living in France when Germany invaded in May 1940. Leonie was taking care of ailing relatives, while Gertrude worked as an ambulance driver for the American Hospital in Paris. In July 1941, Gertrude started working for the bureau for civilians set up by the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association), where she took care of civilians released from prison camps. On September 24, 1942, the Gestapo arrested Leonie as an enemy alien and sent her to a prison in Châlons. From there she was transferred to Frontstalag 194 in Vittel. She remained there for two years until the camp was liberated by Free French forces on September 12, 1944. Gertrude was also arrested in September 1942, and she lived in Vittel for two months before the YMCA secured permission for her release from the Germans. She was arrested again in September 1943, and sent back to Vittel for another six months. Following the liberation of Paris, Gertrude continued her work with the YMCA helping civilians released from prison camps, while Leonie worked for the Red Cross and helped establish the first displaced persons (DP) camp in Paris.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Watercolor of an imposing domed building near Lake Habbaniyah, Irag, created by 23 year old Edward Herzbaum in April 1943. Habbinaya was an RAF (British Royal Air Force) base and colonial town 40 miles east of Baghdad where Edward often went to swim and see movies. Edward was a soldier in the 2nd Polish Corps, now attached to the British Army. The Corps was stationed near Habbiniya from March-September 1943 receiving artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, had left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, he was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for heroism in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. The unit was in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Moritz was on the board of the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, created by the Nazi government in February 1939 to organize Jewish affairs. The Association was eventually forced to assist with deportations. In 1940, Moritz became president of the Berlin Jewish Community. In January 1943, Moritz became president of the Reich Association, when Leo Baeck was deported. On June 10, 1943, the Reich Association was shut down and Moritz and Hildegard were deported to Theresienstadt. Moritz was elected to the Jewish Council and put in charge of the Freizeitgestaltung, which produced cultural events and materials. On May 9, 1945, the camp was liberated by Soviet forces. Moritz and Hildegard went to Deggendorf displaced persons camp, then emigrated to Palestine in 1946.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting 3 German soldiers firing on 3 possibly partisans or Soviet soldiers in the snow. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Small line drawing in ink of a young woman and a man with glasses created by Edward Herzbaum circa 1943. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East which had marched south in 1941-1942 from the Soviet Union to join the British Army in Iraq. They journeyed to the border town of Kanaqin where the British had a large military base and field hospital where many died after the long, arduous march from Russia. There were oil fields near the city and it was also along a major Muslim pilgrimage route. The Corps next went to Habbiniya where from March-September 1943 they received artillery and other military training. Edward, age 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939. He went to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join Anders Army, a Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for their bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 7, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Sketch of a man listening to a radio, perhaps in a barrack, drawn Fritz Vendig, 12, when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Fritz's father's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, the family prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, Fritz, 7, his parents Ernst and Charlotte, his brother Heiner, 2, and his paternal grandmother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Emeric M. Lazar,"Self portrait by Emeric Lazar in 1944 while he was living in hiding Paris, France, after his February 1943 release from Drancy internment camp. Emeric had come to Paris from Budapest in 1928 to study music. He was the house composer at Le Casino de Paris when Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940. France surrendered in June and Paris became the seat of the German military occupation. Anti-Jewish measures were enacted and, in August, an internment camp for foreign Jews was established in Drancy, a northeastern suburb of Paris. Emeric was imprisoned there on August 21, 1941. The camp became a major transit center for the deportation of Jews. In the summer of 1942, the Germans systematically deported Jews from Drancy to killing centers in Poland. On July 10, 1942, Emeric obtained a copy of his French baptism certificate from the archives of the Archbishop of Paris. He was released from Drancy on February 22, 1943. The camp was staffed by French police until July 1, 1943, when the Germans took control of the camp. Emeric lived in hiding in Paris until the city was liberated by American troops on August 25, 1944. Emeric then worked in an American Red Cross nightclub where he met US Army Lieutenant Hedwiga Ferlin. She came to the club during the day to practice the piano. The couple married on October 20, 1945, and left for New York in August 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Annemarie Durra,"Ink line drawing of a red haired man in a suit drawn by Annemarie Loewe Durra in 1944 when she and her husband Willi were interned at Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp in German occupied Czechoslovakia. Annemarie and Willi were deported from Breslau, Germany on April 2, 1943. They were among the last remaining Jews in the city. Theresienstadt played a unique rule as a propaganda tool for the Germans. While by 1943, it was primarily a collection center for deportations to ghettos and killings centers in the east, the camp had an active cultural community. Annemarie, a professional illustrator, continued to draw and Willi, previously the choral director of the Breslau synagogue, directed a choir of inmates. On October 16, 1944, Willi was deported and murdered in Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center. Annemarie was liberated on May 9, 1945, when the Soviet Army entered the camp, two days after Germany’s surrender. On August 9, she was transferred to Deggendorf displaced persons camp in Germany. 2004.357.1 includes several newspapers published in Deggendorf with illustrations by Annemarie; 2007.162.9 is portrsit she drew in Deggendorf.

Esther Lurie,"Three sketches of Masha Rolnikaite (Rolnik) drawn by Esther Lurie, ca. 1965, for the cover of Masha's memoir, Ikh muz dertseyin [I have to tell]. They reproduce the drawing of Masha that Esther made when both were prisoners in Leibitsch slave labor camp. It was published in Esther's book, Jewesses in Slavery, in 1945. Masha, 17, was a deportee from Vilna, Poland (Vilnius, Lithuania), and returned there after liberation. Esther, originally from Liepaja, Latvia, settled in Palestine in 1934. She was visiting her sister in Kovno (Kaunas, Lithuania] in summer 1941, when it was occupied by Germany. She was confined to the ghetto and had to create portraits and paintings for the Germans. She also, at the request of the Jewish Council, dedicated herself to recording the daily life of the residents. In July 1944, the ghetto was liquidated. Esther was sent to Stutthof concentration camp, where she continued to draw. Her family members were sent to Auschwitz and murdered. In August 1944, Esther was deported to Leibitsch, and liberated by the Soviet Army on January 21, 1945. During the journey back to Palestine, she lived in a displaced persons camp in Italy, where her drawings of Leibitsch were exhibited.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Colored pencil still life drawn by 12 year old Fritz Vendig when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Fritz's father's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, the family prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, Fritz, 7, his parents Ernst and Charlotte, his brother Heiner, 2, and his paternal grandmother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Preliminary study with two jeeps carrying soldiers with a sketch of a cliff created by Edward Herzbaum, 24, on May 31, 1944. Several works created by Edward were published during the war in military produced magazines. Edward was a soldier in the 2nd Polish Corps, British Army, which was honored for bravery during the four month 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy. The Allies bombed the 1349 abbey in February and the resulting ruins provided protected defensive positions for German troops, blocking the northward progress of the Allies. The 2nd Polish Corps led the mountain assault in the May victory, the fourth battle waged to break through the German stronghold. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Germany occupied the country in September 1939 for Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, he was exiled to a gulag by Soviet security police. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released in an amnesty of Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps. In February 1944, they joined the 8th British Army in Italy. They were in Italy on VE Day, May 8, 1945 when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother died in Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then worked for two years for the Polish Resettlement Corps and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Charcoal drawing created by David Friedman (before 1960, Friedmann) in 1964, depicting a scene in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where he was sent in late-August 1944. It depicts two long lines of naked women and children entering a doorway marked Bade Anstalt (Bathing Establishment.) Artist's caption: ""This is Auschwitz-Birkenau! This camp, like Maidanek, Treblinka, and many others, was destined to destroy Jewish people. Bathing Establishment was posted outside, but it was also used as a gas-chamber. The Nazis enjoyed to fool us. The camp was full of smoke and a horrible odor, but at that time, we had no knowledge, and would never have believed that the smell came from burned human bodies.""David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Unknown,"Two-sided pencil drawing done by 4 year old Charles Weingarten circa 1944-1945 while living in hiding with his mother. The drawing depicts, on one side, a woman and, on the other side, Roman warrios with shields and swords. Charles was born in 1941 in Italian occupied Nice not long after his mother Margarethe's release from Gurs internment camp. She was a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who had resided primarily in France since the early 1930s. In 1943, the Germans, who had occupied northern France since May 1940, assumed control of much of southern France. Margarethe went into hiding with Charly under assumed identities as Catholics. They lived in poverty on the grounds of an estate and Charly suffered from chronic bronchitis and severe malnutrition. Nice was liberated by American troops in August 1944. After the war ended in May 1945, Charly was sent to a children's home in Switzerland to recuperate.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Abraham Rijksman,"Colored pencil drawing of a yellow field beside a Dutch family’s farmhouse near Genum (Ginnum), Netherlands, created by Abraham Rijksman while in hiding on January 10, 1944. Abraham and his family lived in Amsterdam when German forces occupied the Netherlands in May 1940. His family members were all arrested and deported between October 1942 and May 1943. Abraham was arrested in August 1943, and escaped twice from transport trains to Westerbork transit camp. The second time, he escaped with a pregnant woman, whose friend gave Abraham money to travel north to Friesland. In October, Abraham was forced to flee his first placement when German authorities searched the house. While hiding in nearby fields, Abraham found Jozeph (Joe) de Haan, who had also been forced out of hiding. A local farmer, Klaas Dreijer, offered them refuge in a barn near De Houwen, and later moved them to a hiding place near Holwerd. After two weeks, they were moved again.  This time, they met the Rosier family, who helped hide them. Not long after, Klaas moved Abraham to a different Folkertsma family in Genum, though he sometimes visited Joe and the Rosiers. In May 1944, German authorities caught Abraham and transported him to Westerbork. He was then deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center in German-occupied Poland and selected for slave labor. In mid-January 1945, Abraham was transferred to multiple camps in Germany, including Gross-Rosen, Buchenwald, and one of the Wüste complex subcamps of Natzweiler concentration camp. In mid-April, Abraham was transferred to the München-Allach subcamp of Dachau concentration camp, which was liberated in late April. He returned to the Netherlands and found his sister, Roza, the only other member of his family to survive.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen, depicting a group of Jews interned in the ghetto in Vilna, Lithuania. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Charles Weingarten,"Two-sided colored pencil drawing done by 4 year old Charles Weingarten circa 1944-1945 while living in hiding with his mother. The drawing depicts, on one side, a man walking and, on the other side, a French battleship. Charles was born in 1941 in Italian occupied Nice not long after his mother Margarethe's release from Gurs internment camp. She was a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who had resided primarily in France since the early 1930s. In 1943, the Germans, who had occupied northern France since May 1940, assumed control of much of southern France. Margarethe went into hiding with Charly under assumed identities as Catholics. They lived in poverty on the grounds of an estate and Charly suffered from chronic bronchitis and severe malnutrition. Nice was liberated by American troops in August 1944. After the war ended in May 1945, Charly was sent to a children's home in Switzerland to recuperate.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting the line-up of captured German soldiers; in the background are the bodies of partisans, including a medic, sickened by an illness that struck the camp near the end of the war.  It is from a series of works detailing events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. In spring 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences following a stroke.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Annemarie Durra,"Ink line drawing of an apprehensive man sitting with a notice in his lap drawn by Annemarie Loewe Durra in 1944 when she and her husband Willi were interned at Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp in German occupied Czechoslovakia. Annemarie and Willi were deported from Breslau, Germany, on April 2, 1943. They were among the last remaining Jews in the city. Theresienstadt played a unique rule as a propaganda tool for the Germans. While by 1943, it was primarily a collection center for deportations to ghettos and killings centers in the east, the camp had an active cultural community. Annemarie, a professional cartoonist, continued to draw and Willi, who had been the choral director of the Breslau synagogue, directed a choir of inmates. On October 16, 1944, Willi was deported and murdered in Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center. Annemarie was liberated on May 9, 1945, when the Soviet Army entered the camp, two days after Germany’s surrender. On August 9, she was transferred to Deggendorf displaced persons camp in Germany. 2004.357.1 has newspapers published in Deggendorf with illustrations by Annemarie; 2007.162.9 is a portrait she drew there. In February 1950, she emigrated to the United States.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Sketch of two boys marching with a flag drawn by 13 year old Fritz Vendig when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Fritz's father's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, the family prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, Fritz, 7, his parents Ernst and Charlotte, his brother Heiner, 2, and his paternal grandmother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward was a soldier in the 2nd Polish Corps, British Army, which was honored for bravery during the four month 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy.

Alona Frankel,"Colored pencil drawing of a boy and girl holding a blue and white flag, the national colors of Israel, with a large Star of David created by Ilona Goldman around 1947. During the war, Ilona lived in hiding in Poland from 1942-1944. She made many drawings during this time, especially when, at age four, she was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide her for a fee. Drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ilona with her parents, Salomon and Gusta fled Krakow for Soviet controlled Lvov (Lviv, Ukraine). When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was confined in the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a meat rendering factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak, and his family. However, they would not hide Ilona because they thought it would be too hard to conceal a lively young girl. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with the Seremets. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Germany occupied the country in September 1939. He went to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish forced laborers. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army, a volunteer unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in Italy. They fought their way north and were in Italy in May 1945 when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He resumed the study of architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then worked for two years for the Polish Resettlement Corps and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Drypoint etching printed by David Friedman (before 1960, Friedmann) in 1967, depicting a scene in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where he was sent in late-August 1944. It depicts a bearded man with a Star of David badge, reeling backward, hands raised in terror. Artist's caption: ""This man is kneeling in despair a few seconds before execution.""David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Arie Singer,"Watercolor work by Arie Singer depicting uniformed person watched by German soldiers removing bodies from a pit and placing them in a large outdoor fire. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units who, with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Drawing of hillside cottages by Fritz Vendig, 12, when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Ernst's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, they prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, the family, along with Ernst's mother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Daisy Brand,"Ceramic wall sculpture showing train tracks entering a concentration camp created by Daisy Brand to evoke her ordeal of being imprisoned in multiple concentration camps from 1944-1945. Daisy's art became infused with her Holocaust experience in the 1980s. Her references are suggestive and deliberately ambiguous and she keeps the exact meaning of the symbolism in her work private, thus more evocative and universal. Daisy and her family lived in Chust, Hungary, when it was occupied by the Germans in March 1944. By May, Daisy and her family were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Her father went directly to the gas chamber. Daisy, age 15, her sister, Mary, age 19, and her mother, Aranka, age 39, were selected as forced labor for Kaiserwald. In July 1944, that camp was evacuated as Soviet and American forces approached. Aranka disappeared during the death march. Daisy and Mary then were transferred to multiple concentration camps: Dondagen II, Libau, Stutthof, and Buchenwald. On April 17, Buchenwald was evacuated and the inmates began a forced march to Dachau. They were freed by American forces near Wurzen, Germany, on April 24, 1945. In mid-May, Daisy and Mary were repatriated to their native city, Bratislava, in Czechoslovakia. With the help of the Red Cross, they found an aunt and uncle who took in the girls. This couple, and one other aunt, were their only relatives to survive the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch of Tuvia Szeres, a 24 year old partisan fighter known as Tevko the Tiger, created by Alexander Bogen while he was a partisan fighter in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia during World War II. Bogen was an art student in Vilna (Vilnius) in June1941 when Germany occupied Lithuania. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped and joined the partisans, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He was in the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans in September 1943. When Lithuania was liberated in summer 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies. Tuvia was also interned in Vilna ghetto, escaping in 1943 to join the partisans. He was with the Chapaev Unit. After the war ended in May 1945, Tuvia did aid work in Italy, helping displaced persons with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and assisting Bricha, which helped survivors illegally emigrate to Palestine.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Lithograph created from a drawing done by Alexander Bogen, following the liberation of the Vilna region. It depicts a little girl wearing a six-pointed star. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania. Imprisoned in the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He joined the all-Jewish Nekhama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Charles was born in 1941 in Italian occupied Nice not long after his mother Margarethe's release from Gurs internment camp. She was a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who had resided primarily in France since the early 1930s. In 1943, the Germans, who had occupied northern France since May 1940, assumed control of much of southern France. Margarethe went into hiding with Charly under assumed identities as Catholics. They lived in poverty on the grounds of an estate and Charly suffered from chronic bronchitis and severe malnutrition. Nice was liberated by American troops in August 1944. After the war ended in May 1945, Charly was sent to a children's home in Switzerland to recuperate.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Ernst Vendig,"Sketch of an imaginary aerial battle done by Fritz Vendig, 12, when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Ernst's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, they prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, the family, along with Ernst's mother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Multicolored watercolor of people wearing yellow Star of David badges crammed into an underground shelter. It was created by Arie Singer, part of a series circa 1985-2000, based upon his memories as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests near Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and Belarus circa 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded in June 1941, German mobile killing units, with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the Ponary massacres in 1941. Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped during liquidation of the ghetto. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, and joined the partisans. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After years in dp camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Halina Olomucki,"Charcoal drawing of a woman and child behind a fence created by Halina Olszewski (later Olomucki) in 1944 when she was a prisoner in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. It depicts a scene from her experiences in Warsaw Ghetto from 1940-1943. Nazi Germany occupied Poland in September 1939, and, in fall 1940, Halina, her mother Margarit-Hadassa, and siblings were relocated to the ghetto. Halina did forced labor, but she felt her real job was to record the misery and suffering of ghetto residents. Halina smuggled many drawings to a non-Jewish friend outside the ghetto. In May 1943, she and her mother were deported to Majdanek where her mother was killed on arrival. In July, Halina was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she continued to create art in secret. Other prisoners asked her to draw them or their loved ones, to preserve their memory and show the world what happened. She hid artwork in the camp, much of it recovered postwar. On January 18, 1945, Halina was sent by death march to Ravensbrück and Neustadt-Glewe, where she was liberated on May 2, 1945. She returned to Warsaw but found no surviving family members.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

Alona Frankel,"Colored pencil drawing of a bearded man in a robe and headscarf leading a camel with rider created by 5 year old Ilona Goldman while living in hiding in Poland from 1942-1944. In spring 1942, Ilona was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide Ilona for a fee. These drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. Many drawings were done on the weekly letters Hania sent to Ilona's parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ilona and her parents, Salomon and Gusta, fled Krakow for Russian controlled Lvov (Lviv, Ukraine). When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was forced into the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a meat factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak. However, he would not hide Ilona because it would be too hard to conceal a lively 4 year-old. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with a Polish woman paid to hide her. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen while he was a partisan fighter in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia during World War II. The sketch depicts two of his fellow partisans. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Colored pencil drawing of an imaginary landscape done by Fritz Vendig, 12, when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Ernst's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, they prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, the family, along with Ernst's mother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting a group of armed partisans marching through the forest. It is from a series of works created from 1985-2000 detailing memories of his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. In spring 1943, Arie and his mother, Chaya, 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Harold Lehman,"Pencil sketch by Harold Lehman of a soldier in right profile pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth. Through a partnership with Associated American Artists and the United States Treasury Department, Abbott Laboratories created a program to produce war bond advertisement posters for distribution across the United States. Reeves Lewenthal, head of the Associated American Artists, met with Lehman and asked him to design a poster with the theme of an invasion of Europe. Lehman took a piece of Lewenthal’s note paper and immediately drew this sketch in his office, The sketch was used as a study for the poster ""Get Your Might into the Fight"" (see 2016.547.3). The image, a right profile close up of a soldier’s face, is an adaptation of Michelangelo’s David. In place of the sling on David’s shoulder is a grenade in the soldier’s mouth. An award winning painter, muralist and sculptor, Harold Lehman was known for making political statements with his artwork. He was born and raised in New York City, but moved to Los Angeles as a teenager, attending the Otis Art Institute. While in L.A. he worked with Phil Guston, Jackson Pollock, D.A. Siqueiros, and Manuel Tolegain. In 1941, Harold moved back to New York and continued his career, working with the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and the Federal Art Project, both New Deal programs to employ artists. He also worked with the Treasury department and Abbott Laboratories to create other War Bond advertisements, pro-American propaganda, and anti-fascist pieces.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Daisy Brand,"Ceramic wall sculpture showing 2 sets of train tracks entering camp gates created by Daisy Brand to evoke her ordeal of being imprisoned in multiple concentration camps from 1944-1945. Daisy's art became infused with her Holocaust experience in the 1980s. Her references are suggestive and deliberately ambiguous and she keeps the exact meaning of the symbolism in her work private, thus more evocative and universal.  Daisy and her family lived in Chust, Hungary, when it was occupied by the Germans in March 1944. By May, Daisy and her family were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Her father went directly to the gas chamber. Daisy, aged 15, her sister, Mary, aged 19, and her mother, Aranka, aged 39, were selected as forced labor for Kaiserwald concentration camp. In July 1944, the camp was evacuated as Soviet and American forces approached. Aranka disappeared during the forced march. Daisy and Mary were transferred to multiple concentration camps: Dondagen II, Libau, Stutthof, and Buchenwald. On April 17, Buchenwald was evacuated; camp inmates began a forced march to Dachau. They were freed by American forces near Wurzen, Germany, on April 24, 1945. In mid-May, Daisy and her sister were repatriated to their native city, Bratislava, in Czechoslovakia. With the help of the Red Cross, they found an aunt and uncle who took in the girls. This couple, and one other aunt, were their only relatives to survive the Holocaust.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Abraham Rijksman,"Colored pencil drawing of the interior of a cow barn on a Dutch family’s farm near Genum (Ginnum), Netherlands, created by Abraham Rijksman while in hiding on January 20, 1944. Abraham and his family lived in Amsterdam when German forces occupied the Netherlands in May 1940. His family members were all arrested and deported between October 1942 and May 1943. Abraham was arrested in August 1943, and escaped twice from transport trains to Westerbork transit camp. The second time, he escaped with a pregnant woman, whose friend gave Abraham money to travel north to Friesland. In October, Abraham was forced to flee his first placement when German authorities searched the house. While hiding in nearby fields, Abraham found Jozeph (Joe) de Haan, who had also been forced out of hiding. A local farmer, Klaas Dreijer, offered them refuge in a barn near De Houwen, and later moved them to a hiding place near Holwerd. After two weeks, they were moved again.  This time, they met the Rosier family, who helped hide them. Not long after, Klaas moved Abraham to a different Folkertsma family in Genum, though he sometimes visited Joe and the Rosiers. In May 1944, German authorities caught Abraham and transported him to Westerbork. He was then deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center in German-occupied Poland and selected for slave labor. In mid-January 1945, Abraham was transferred to multiple camps in Germany, including Gross-Rosen, Buchenwald, and one of the Wüste complex subcamps of Natzweiler concentration camp. In mid-April, Abraham was transferred to the München-Allach subcamp of Dachau concentration camp, which was liberated in late April. He returned to the Netherlands and found his sister, Roza, the only other member of his family to survive.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Kladderadatsch,"Reprint of an illustration, Nervous Warriors, from a pro-Nazi Party magazine, Kladderadatsch, of caricatured Jewish men waging war with a minefield of chamberpots and weapons consisting of newspapers and musical instruments. It was published in a 1944 issue of Kladderadatsch, an illustrated satirical magazine issued in Berlin, Germany, from 1848-1944. The magazine was a popular success with the middle class from the start, and like its audience, grew more conservative over the years. Under editor Paul Warncke (1909-1933), it was strongly nationalistic, praising Hitler for his patriotism after the 1923 Munich Putsch. It grew increasingly antisemitic, and was an energetic supporter of Hitler and the Nazi Party. This print is one of more than 900 items in the Katz Ehrenthal Collection of antisemitic visual materials.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen while he was a partisan fighter in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia during World War II. The sketch depicts a group of his fellow partisans. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting partisans blowing up a Nazi train. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 detailing memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. In spring 1943, Arie and his mother, Chaya, 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Watercolor study of the ruins of Monte Cassino abbey viewed through camouflage netting painted by 24 year old Edward Herzbaum on May 31, 1944. Edward was a soldier in the 5th Kresowa, 2nd Polish Corps, which was honored for their bravery during the four month long 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy. The Allies bombed the 1349 abbey in February and the resulting ruins provided protected defensive positions for German troops. The 2nd Polish Corps led the mountain assault in the May 1944 victory, the fourth battle waged by Allied forces to break through the German stronghold blocking the way north.

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting 2 armed partisans on guard for a group of 6 at work dismantling a railroad track near tilled fields in a forest clearing. It is from a series created from 1985-2000 based upon memories and events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. As the pogroms continued into the spring of 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, age 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences in the mid 1980s as rehabilitation following a stroke in 1975.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Charcoal drawing created by David Friedmann (from 1960, Friedman) circa 1945-48, depicting a scene in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where he was sent in late-August 1944. It depicts a large crowd of naked women and children being herded by shadowy armed soldiers into a big pit to be shot.David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945.He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Jo (Joseph) Spier,"Watercolor drawing created by Jo Spier and given to Moritz and Hildegard Henschel while they were imprisoned in Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp from June 1943-May 1945. It shows people dancing through a stone gate, leaving behind a trail of Star of David badges. Spier, a Jewish artist from the Netherlands, was arrested for creating a satirical cartoon of Hitler in 1943 and deported to Theresienstadt with his wife and three children. They returned to Amsterdam after liberation. Moritz was an influential lawyer in Berlin when Hitler came to power in Germany in January 1933. As government persecution of Jews intensified, Moritz and Hildegard sent their daughters Marianne, 15, to Palestine and Lilly, 13, to England in 1939. Moritz was on the board of the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, created by the Nazi government in February 1939 to organize Jewish affairs. The Association was eventually forced to assist with deportations. In 1940, Moritz became president of the Berlin Jewish Community. In January 1943, Moritz became president of the Reich Association, when Leo Baeck was deported. On June 10, 1943, the Reich Association was shut down and Moritz and Hildegard were deported to Theresienstadt. Moritz was elected to the Jewish Council and put in charge of the Freizeitgestaltung, which produced cultural events and materials. On May 9, 1945, the camp was liberated by Soviet forces. Moritz and Hildegard went to Deggendorf displaced persons camp, then immigrated to Palestine in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alona Frankel,"Birthday story with a drawing of a couple picking mushrooms with a gnome created by 7 year old Ilona Goldman and her mother while in hiding in Lvov, Poland (L'viv, Ukraine)  July 4, 1944. Ilona dictated this story to her mother as a gift for her father's birthday. Both of Ilona's parents suffered from the lack of cigarettes. The gnome, the man, and the house are all smoking and in the drawing Ilona wished her parents could have as many cigarettes as they wanted. The story tells of a boy and girl seeing a gnome's house near the forest, a witch on a broom, and the girl's worrying that she had no basket to gather mushrooms. Ilona lived in hiding in Poland from 1942-1944. In spring 1942, at age four, she was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide her for a fee. Drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ilona with her parents, Salomon and Gusta, fled Krakow for Soviet controlled Lvov. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was forced into the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak. However, he would not hide Ilona because it would be too hard to conceal a lively young girl. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with the Seremets. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and the medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arie Singer,"Painting by Arie (Aryeh) Singer depicting himself carrying the flag for a group of partisans meeting with Soviet soldiers in southern Ukraine, near Kiev.  It is from a series of works detailing events from his youth as a 13 year old partisan fighter in the forests northeast of Vilna, Poland, (Vilnius, Lithuania) and in Belarus from 1943-1944. After the Soviet occupation of Vilna in late 1939, Arie's family fled to Glembokie (Hlybokaye, Belarus). When Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, the area was assaulted by German mobile killing units, who with the help of the local populace, murdered thousands of Jews. Arie and his mother were forced into the Jewish ghetto. His father, Zvi, age 38, was killed in the massacres at Ponary in 1941. In spring 1943,  Arie and his mother, Chaya, 35, escaped the ghetto, which was being destroyed by the Germans. They went into hiding in the Nievier Forest near Vilna, where they engaged in partisan activities. The area was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944. After some years in a displaced persons camps, Arie and Chaya emigrated to Israel in the late 1940s. Colonel Singer began creating this series of paintings about his Holocaust experiences as rehabilitation following a stroke.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Abraham Rijksman,"Colored pencil drawing of Mr. de Lintrekker working at a spinning wheel in a Dutch family’s farmhouse near Genum (Ginnum), Netherlands, created by Abraham Rijksman while in hiding on January 10, 1944. Abraham and his family lived in Amsterdam when German forces occupied the Netherlands in May 1940. His family members were all arrested and deported between October 1942 and May 1943. Abraham was arrested in August 1943, and escaped twice from transport trains to Westerbork transit camp. The second time, he escaped with a pregnant woman, whose friend gave Abraham money to travel north to Friesland. In October, Abraham was forced to flee his first placement when German authorities searched the house. While hiding in nearby fields, Abraham found Jozeph (Joe) de Haan, who had also been forced out of hiding. A local farmer, Klaas Dreijer, offered them refuge in a barn near De Houwen, and later moved them to a hiding place near Holwerd. After two weeks, they were moved again.  This time, they met the Rosier family, who helped hide them. Not long after, Klaas moved Abraham to a different Folkertsma family in Genum, though he sometimes visited Joe and the Rosiers. In May 1944, German authorities caught Abraham and transported him to Westerbork. He was then deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center in German-occupied Poland and selected for slave labor. In mid-January 1945, Abraham was transferred to multiple camps in Germany, including Gross-Rosen, Buchenwald, and one of the Wüste complex subcamps of Natzweiler concentration camp. In mid-April, Abraham was transferred to the München-Allach subcamp of Dachau concentration camp, which was liberated in late April. He returned to the Netherlands and found his sister, Roza, the only other member of his family to survive.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military.

Edward H. Hartry,"Pencil line drawing of a young woman in profile created by 24 year old Edward Herzbaum in Italy in 1944. See 2012.471.81 for another version of this drawing. Edward was a soldier in the Polish Army of the East and then the 5th Kresowa, 2nd Polish Corps, British Army from 1941-1945.

Rupprecht was arrested by the US Army in 1945, tried by a German denazification court, and sentenced to six years hard labor. Streicher was tried by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, convicted, and executed per the ruling that his repeated articles calling for the annihilation of the Jewish race were a direct indictment to murder and a crime against humanity.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Watercolor portrait created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Leendert J. Jordaan,"De Waanzin Breekt Los [The Madness Breaks Loose], a print of a drawing by Dutch cartoonist Leendert Jordaan illustrating the terror and coming destruction of the Jewish population of the Netherlands during the German occupation, May 1940- May 1945. Netherlands had an SS controlled administration which put in place policies to persecute and isolate Jews. In 1941, Jews forbidden [Voor Joden Verboden] signs were posted all over Amsterdam. In 1942, the Dutch Nazi Party (NSB) member, Jan Feitsma, who from 1941 was the Attorney General of Amsterdam, had all the signs replaced with ones he designed bearing his name, as shown in the drawing. Feitsma collaborated with the Germans in the 1941 imprisonment of thousands of Jews in forced labor camps, and in 1942, with the deportations to concentration camps. In 1943, there was an assassination attempt on Feitsma. He was killed in a second attempt on February 2, 1945. The drawing was published in a book of Jordaan's work, Nachtmerrie over Nederland : een herinnerings-album [Nightmare in the Netherlands] in 1945 after the war ended in May.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward Vebell,"Drawing of courtroom observers, two in military uniforms with CMP patches, created by 24 year-old Edward Vebell, illustrator and US soldier, from the press gallery during the first months of the 1945 Trial of German Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany. Ed sat in the gallery for three days and used field glasses to capture the details of the defendant's faces. He had no water, so he had to use spit to create the halftones that add detail and nuance. Ed did 90% of his drawing in the courtroom, seeking to bring intimacy to the historical proceedings. The sketches were published in the US Army newspaper Stars and Stripes on December 9, 1945. The Waterman fountain pen he used for the drawings is record 2005.426.1. Ed was drafted into the US Army in 1942, and was the first staff illustrator for Stars and Stripes. His other assignments included combat zones in Italy and France. Soon after the defeat of Nazi Germany on May 7 in western Europe and May 9, 1945, in eastern Europe, the Allies: Great Britain, France, Soviet Union, and the United States convened an International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg, Germany. Its purpose was to seek justice for crimes against humanity, evidenced by the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany. In October 1945, the IMT formally indicted the Nuremberg defendants on four counts: crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and conspiracy to commit these crimes. The verdicts were delivered on October 1, 1946. Twelve defendants were sentenced to death; three to life imprisonment; four to prison terms ranging from 10-20 years; three were acquitted.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Charcoal drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Emeric M. Lazar,"Watercolor sketch of his studio in Paris created by Emeric Lazar in 1945. Emeric had come to Paris from Budapest in 1928 to study music. He was the house composer at Le Casino de Paris when Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940. France surrendered in June and Paris became the seat of the German military occupation. Anti-Jewish measures were enacted and, in August, an internment camp for foreign Jews was established in Drancy, a northeastern suburb of Paris. Emeric was imprisoned there by August 21, 1941. The camp became a major transit center for the deportation of Jews. In the summer of 1942, the Germans systematically deported Jews from Drancy to killing centers in Poland. On July 10, 1942, Emeric obtained a copy of his French baptism certificate from the archives of the Archbishop of Paris. He was released from Drancy on February 22, 1943. The camp was staffed by French police until July 1, 1943, when the Germans took control of the camp. Emeric lived in hiding in Paris until the city was liberated by American troops on August 25, 1944. Emeric then worked in an American Red Cross nightclub where he met US Army Lieutenant Hedwiga Ferlin. She came to the club during the day to practice the piano. The couple married on October 20, 1945, and left for New York in August 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Drawing of a ship entering port done by Fritz Vendig, 12, while living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, younger brother Heiner, and paternal grandmother Pauline. In the mid-1930s, Fritz's father's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, the family prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, Fritz, 7, his parents Ernst and Charlotte, his brother Heiner, 2, and his paternal grandmother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Charcoal drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Charcoal drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen while he was a partisan fighter in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia during World War II. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Watercolor of three trees in a rolling, barren landscape near Castrocaro, a small spa town near Bologna, Italy. It was painted by Edward Herzbaum in March 1945 while his unit of the 2nd Polish Corps advanced through Italy during the war. Edward was a soldier in the 2nd Polish Corps from 1941-1945. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. He was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army, a volunteer Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the British 8th Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on VE Day,  May 8, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Colored pencil drawing of the lake by 13 year old Fritz Vendig when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Fritz's father's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, the family prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, Fritz, 7, his parents Ernst and Charlotte, his brother Heiner, 2, and his paternal grandmother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward Vebell,"Ink drawing of the German defense counsel wearing headsets seated at their table created by 24 year-old Edward Vebell, illustrator and US soldier, from the press gallery during the first months of the 1945 Trial of German Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany. Ed sat in the gallery for three days and used field glasses to capture the details of the defendant's faces. He had no water, so he had to use spit to create the halftones that add detail and nuance. Ed did 90% of his drawing in the courtroom, seeking to bring intimacy to the historical proceedings. The sketches were published in the US Army newspaper Stars and Stripes on December 9, 1945.  The Waterman fountain pen he used for the drawings is record 2005.426.1. Ed was drafted into the US Army in 1942, and was the first staff illustrator for Stars and Stripes. His other assignments included combat zones in Italy and France. Soon after the defeat of Nazi Germany on May 7 in western Europe and May 9, 1945, in eastern Europe, the Allies: Great Britain, France, Soviet Union, and the United States convened an International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg, Germany. Its purpose was to seek justice for crimes against humanity, evidenced by the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany. In October 1945, the IMT formally indicted the Nuremberg defendants on four counts: crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and conspiracy to commit these crimes. The verdicts were delivered on October 1, 1946. Twelve defendants were sentenced to death; three to life imprisonment; four to prison terms ranging from 10-20 years; three were acquitted.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those suspected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on trial for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Aquatint created by Leo Haas in 1966 based upon sketches made in 1945 shortly after the end of the war. It is based on scenes he witnessed in 1942 while an inmate of Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp. It depicts inmates disembarking from a transport train in the pouring rain. Haas was an inmate of Terezin from September 1942-October 1944. Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the misery and suffering of daily life in the ghetto. They hid their work in the camp, and much was recovered postwar. In summer 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp and were arrested and tortured. In October, Haas was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by American troops.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Annemarie Durra,"Watercolor portrait of Carl Atkin, former director of Deggendorf displaced persons camp in the American zone of Germany, and created by Annemarie Loewe Durra in 1945. On August 9, 1945, Annemarie arrived at Deggendorf after she and many other former prisoners were transferred from Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp where they had been imprisoned in German-occupied Czechoslovakia. There was an active cultural community at Deggendorf and Annemarie contributed illustrations to the Deggendorf Center Review, a newspaper issued by the camp’s Jewish Committee. Prior to the end of World War II in 1945, Carl accepted a post with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), an international humanitarian organization. On August 23, 1945, he led UNRRA Team 55 to the poorly run Deggendorf DP camp in the American-occupied zone of Germany, where they took over management. Carl and his team stabilized the food supply, secured housing facilities, fostered cultural life with lectures, concerts, and performances. Praised for his leadership, improvement of living conditions, and boosting of morale at Deggendorf, he left his directorship in December 1945, and was appointed UNRRA’s Coordinator of Jewish Affairs. In March 1946, he returned to the US, rejoined his family in Los Angeles, and continued to work for the organization. On July 2, 1947, UNRRA terminated its activities and Carl transitioned into sales and advertising, financial management for a nightclub that he co-owned, and eventually aerospace production management and documentation.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those suspected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on trial for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Impressionistic watercolor of a castle on the shoreline near San Severo, Italy, created by Edward Herzbaum in June 1945 when he traveled around Italy after the war before studying architecture in Rome. During World War II, Edward served in the Polish Army of the East, which became the Second Polish Corps, British Army. See 2012.471.96, .97, and 101 for other versions of this palace. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, Edward was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army, a volunteer Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the British 8th Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on VE Day, May 8, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Charcoal drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

David Friedman,"Framed oil painting created by David Friedmann (from 1960, Friedman) in 1946, based upon scenes he witnessed after his liberation on January 25, 1945, following a death march to Blechhammer slave labor camp. The painting depicts a long line of men in prison garb walking in the snow; a dead body on the roadside. Artist's caption: ""It was a long way home and it wasn't unusual to see comrades as well as German soldiers dead on the road.""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     David Friedmann was a successful painter and graphic artist who lived in Berlin from 1911-1938. He was renowned for his portraits drawn from life and became a leading press artist of the 1920’s. In 1933, his prewar career abruptly ended with the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. In December 1938, he escaped to Prague with his wife, Mathilde, and infant daughter, Mirjam Helene. In October 1941, they were deported to the Jewish Ghetto in Łódź, Poland. In late August 1944, the family was separated and sent to Auschwitz death camp, where his wife and child were murdered. He was sent to the subcamp Gleiwitz I, because musicians were sought for a camp orchestra, but Friedmann’s life was saved because of his painting and quick-sketching portrait abilities. The camp was evacuated due to approaching Soviet forces. The inmates were forced on a death march to Blechhammer, where Friedmann was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. He journeyed to Poland and stayed in Krakow until the war ended in early May 1945. He then returned to Prague and painted the scenes that haunted his memory to show the world and give voice to those who could not be heard. In January 1946, he had his first exhibition of his Holocaust artwork. Friedmann and his second wife, Hildegard, a fellow concentration camp survivor, fled the Stalinist Communists for Israel in 1949. They had a daughter also named Miriam, and the family moved to the United States in 1954.","Conditions on Use: Copyright, trademark, and all literary rights are retained by the heir of David Friedman, Miriam Friedman Morris.

Unknown,"A painting that hung on the wall in the room where Irena Ehrlich vel Sluszny and her family lived in the Bindermichl displaced persons camp, from 1945-1947. Irena, her parents, Felicia and Seweryn, and younger sister, Danuta, were confined to the Warsaw ghetto in 1940. In March 1943, 19-year-old Irena escaped to the Christian sector of Warsaw.  April 1943 brought the Warsaw ghetto uprising and its violent suppression by the Germans, with mass deportations of all Jews in Warsaw and the annihilation of the ghetto. Her father, aged 39, was killed during the uprising. Her mother and 14 year old sister escaped and were hidden for the rest of the war by Juana Dylag. Irena was deported to a slave labor camp in Berlin. Felicia, Danuta, and Irena were reunited in Warsaw after the war. From 1945-1947, they were in the Bindermichl displaced persons camp in Linz, Austria. They immigrated to the United States on the SS Marine Perch in 1947.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward H. Hartry,"Pencil drawing in diagonal parallel strokes of three cypress trees at the foot of a hill with a fortress near Castrocaro, a small spa town near Bologna, Italy. It was drawn by Edward Herzbaum in March 1945 while his unit of the 2nd Polish Corps, the 5th Kresowa, advanced through Italy during the war. See 2012.471.102 for another view of this scene. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, he was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. He was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army, a volunteer Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps in the British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the British 8th Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought their way north and was honored for its heroic service in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on May 8, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Halina Olomucki,"Drawing of Jewish men whose beards have been shaved off created by Halina Olszewski (later Olomucki) in 1945, just after the war. It depicts a scene she witnessed while interned in Warsaw Ghetto from October 1940-May 1943. The full beards worn by traditional Orthodox Jewish males as a sign of piety were a convenient target for occupying German troops who would shave off the beards in public, using abusive and humiliating methods. Nazi Germany occupied Poland in September 1939, and, in fall 1940, Halina, her mother Margarit-Hadassa, and siblings were relocated to the ghetto. Halina did forced labor, but she felt her real job was to record the misery and suffering of ghetto residents. Halina smuggled many drawings to a non-Jewish friend outside the ghetto. In May 1943, she and her mother were deported to Majdanek where her mother was killed on arrival. In July, Halina was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she continued to create art in secret. Other prisoners asked her to draw them or their loved ones to preserve their memory and show the world what happened. She hid artwork in the camp, much of it recovered postwar. On January 18, 1945, Halina was sent by death march to Ravensbrück and Neustadt-Glewe, where she was liberated on May 2, 1945. She returned to Warsaw but found no surviving family members.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those suspected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on trial for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Edward Vebell,"Ink drawings of 5 defense lawyers in their judicial robes created by 24 year-old Edward Vebell, illustrator and US soldier, from the press gallery during the first months of the 1945 Trial of German Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany. Ed sat in the gallery for three days and used field glasses to capture the details of the defendant's faces. He had no water, so he had to use spit to create the halftones that add detail and nuance. Ed did 90% of his drawing in the courtroom, seeking to bring intimacy to the historical proceedings. The sketches were published in the US Army newspaper Stars and Stripes on December 9, 1945. The Waterman fountain pen Edward used for the drawings is record 2005.426.1.  Ed was drafted into the US Army in 1942, and was the first staff illustrator for Stars and Stripes. His other assignments included combat zones in Italy and France. Soon after the defeat of Nazi Germany on May 7 in western Europe and May 9, 1945, in eastern Europe, the Allies: Great Britain, France, Soviet Union, and the United States convened an International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg, Germany. Its purpose was to seek justice for crimes against humanity, evidenced by the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany. In October 1945, the IMT formally indicted the Nuremberg defendants on four counts: crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and conspiracy to commit these crimes. The verdicts were delivered on October 1, 1946. Twelve defendants were sentenced to death; three to life imprisonment; four to prison terms ranging from 10-20 years; three were acquitted.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Hartry,"Silhouette style ink drawing of soldiers around the gun turret of a tank advancing through Bologna, Italy, created by 25 year old Edward Herzbaum for a Polish soldiers' magazine, ""Uwaga Nadchodzi!"" after the April 1945 battle in Bologna, Italy. Edward was a soldier in the 2nd Polish Corps which joined the British 8th Army for the Italian campaign in 1944. He participated in the four month long Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy from January -May 1944, during which the 2nd Polish Corps led the mountain assault in the May 1944 victory. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, he was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army, a volunteer unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps, British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the 8th British Army in Italy. They fought their way north and were in Italy in May 1945 when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946.

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those suspected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on trial for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Charcoal drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Double-sided drawing created by Leo Haas with a satiric cartoon of Pope Pius XII blessing SS Chief Himmler on one side and a prisoner roll call at Mauthausen concentration camp where he was an inmate in spring 1945 on the other. For another version of this drawing see 2002.490.8. Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the misery and suffering of daily life in the ghetto. They hid their work in the camp, and much was recovered postwar. In summer 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp and were arrested and tortured. In October, Haas was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by American troops.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alexander Bogen,"Sketch created by Alexander Bogen while he was a partisan fighter in the Naroch Forest in Belarussia during World War II. Bogen was an art student in Vilna in 1941 when Germany invaded and occupied Lithuania and neighboring countries. In the Vilna ghetto, he sketched scenes of the life of his fellow Jews interned there by the Germans. “An artist doomed to death,” he said in later years, “recording and so preserving those doomed to death.” In 1943, he escaped the ghetto and joined the partisans, who carried out sabotage and other actions against the occupying German military. He helped lead the all-Jewish Nekama (Revenge) partisan brigade, and reentered the Vilna ghetto to help underground fighters escape as it was being liquidated by the Germans. When Lithuania was liberated in 1944 by Soviet forces, he returned to Vilna and resumed his studies.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Ink drawing created by Leo Haas depicting prisoner roll call at Mauthausen concentration camp where he was an inmate in spring 1945. For another version of this drawing see 2003.202.16. Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist Party member. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the conditions of daily life in the camp. In summer of 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp. Haas was arrested and tortured. In October, he was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by US troops.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Charcoal drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Halina Olomucki,"Colored drawing of a bunk crowded with ill and despairing women created by Halina Olszewski (later Olomucki) in Warsaw in 1945, just after the war. It is based upon her experiences as an inmate of the notorious Block 10 in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp from July 1943 to January 1945. Nazi Germany occupied Poland in September 1939, and, in fall 1940, Halina, her mother Margarit-Hadassa, and siblings were relocated to the ghetto. Halina did forced labor, but she felt her real job was to record the misery and suffering of ghetto residents. Halina smuggled many drawings to a non-Jewish friend outside the ghetto. In May 1943, she and her mother were deported to Majdanek where her mother was killed on arrival. In July, Halina was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she continued to create art in secret. Other prisoners asked her to draw them or their loved ones, to preserve their memory and show the world what happened. She hid artwork in the camp, much of it recovered postwar. On January 18, 1945, Halina was sent by death march to Ravensbrück and Neustadt-Glewe, where she was liberated on May 2, 1945. She returned to Warsaw but found no surviving family members.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use. Copyright status unknown.

Alona Frankel,"Two-sided pencil drawing of a woman with a veil and gown created by Ilona Goldman. On the back is an unfinished sketch of a bearded man in a mitre and fur trimmed outfit, possibly Kris Kringle or a priest. During the war, Ilona lived in hiding from 1942-1944. In spring 1942, Ilona was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide her for a fee. Drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, lona with her parents, Salomon and Gusta, fled Krakow for Soviet controlled Lvov (Lviv, Ukraine). When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was forced into the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a meat rendering factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak. However, he would not hide Ilona because it would be too hard to conceal a lively 4 year-old. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with a Polish woman paid to hide her. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and the medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those suspected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on trial for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Fred Vendig,"Sketch of two boys, possibly Fritz and his brother Heiner, listening to radio reports by Fritz Vendig, 12, when he was living as a refugee from Nazi Germany in Maur, Switzerland, with his parents, Ernst and Charlotte, and younger brother Heiner. In the mid-1930s, Ernst's business was taken from him when it was Aryanized, or cleansed of Jews. In November 1938, Ernst was arrested during Kristallnacht. After his release, they prepared to leave. On May 13, 1939, the family, along with Ernst's mother Pauline, sailed for Cuba on the MS St. Louis. Cuban authorities refused entry to nearly all passengers. Appeals were made to the Cuban and US governments, but the ship had to return to Europe. The family was given refuge in Belgium. In May 1940, Germany occupied Belgium and Ernst was deported to France and imprisoned in St. Cyprien and then Gurs internment camps. In 1941, Charlotte, the boys, and Pauline obtained false papers and illegally entered France to be near Ernst. In August 1942, they were all interned at Les Milles and then Rivesaltes, until Charlotte's sister in Switzerland managed to get them out of the camp and smuggled into Zurich. The war ended in May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Fritz (later Fred) and his family emigrated to the United States in 1946.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

During World War II, Edward served in the Polish Army of the East, which became the Second Polish Corps, British Army. See 2012.471.97, 100, and 101 for other versions of this palace. Edward, 19, left Łódź, Poland, shortly after Nazi Germany occupied the country in September 1939 to stay with family in Soviet controlled Lvov. In June 1940, he was arrested by Soviet security police and exiled to a forced labor camp. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Edward was released as part of an amnesty granted to Polish prisoners. He headed south to join the Polish Army of the East, known as Anders Army, a volunteer Polish military unit formed by General Anders per agreement with Stalin. In August 1942, the unit left Soviet territory and became the 2nd Polish Corps, British Army. In February 1944, they deployed to join the British 8th Army in the Italian Campaign. The Corps fought its way north and was honored for bravery in the May 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino. They were in Italy on VE Day, May 8, 1945, when the war ended. Edward learned that his mother had died in the Łódź Ghetto in 1943. He studied architecture in Rome until the British decided to allow Polish Corps veterans to immigrate to England in October 1946. He then served in the Polish Resettlement Corps for two years and completed his degree.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Charcoal drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Richard Grune,"Lithograph created by Richard Grune soon after the war to publicize the barbaric conditions he experienced or witnessed as a prisoner in concentration camps and prisons in Germany from 1935-1945. Grune was a Bauhaus trained artist who moved to Berlin in February 1933. Hitler had been appointed Chancellor that January and was transforming the government to a Nazi-controlled dictatorship. Nazi ideology demanded racial and cultural purity and homosexuality was antithetical to this vision. Under the new government, those suspected of violating a pre-existing statute, Article 6, §175, which punished indecent acts between men, were targeted for arrest. In December 1934, Grune was denounced and arrested. Under interrogation, he admitted to being homosexual. He was held in protective custody for five months, then put on trial for violating §175. In September 1936, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, the Gestapo kept Grune in protective custody, asserting that his sentence had been too lenient. In October 1937, Grune was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940, he was transferred to Flossenbürg. Five years later, in April 1945, as American forces approached, the camp was evacuated and Grune escaped. He began work on a series of artwork to show the horrific conditions of the German-run camps to the world. In 1947, the works were exhibited and published as Passion des xx. jahrhunderts, one of the most important records of Nazi brutality published in the immediate postwar period.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Simon Jeruchim,"Cartoon created by Simon Jeruchim, 16, in Paris soon after the war ended in May 1945. He drew it for his brother Michel, 8, who was still in Normandy with the Leclerc family that hid him during the war. Simon had joined the Boy Scouts and he wanted to show his brother the mad scene at the Montparnasse railroad station in Paris after the troop returned from a camping trip. Transportation was not yet back to normal in Paris, so trains were often ridiculously overcrowded. Simon lived in hiding in Normandy from June 1942. He returned to Paris to live with family friends, the Bonneaus, once it was liberated in August 1944. Germany occupied France in June 1940, but Simon, parents, Samuel and Sonia, and siblings, Alice,14, and Michel, remained near Paris until summer 1942. In July, Sonia heard of the Vel d'Hiv roundup, when thousands of Jews were arrested. The family hid with their gentile housekeeper and then arranged for the Bonneaus to hide the children separately in Normandy. Simon often posed as a Catholic and moved to different homes. The siblings were reunited after May 1945. Their parents were deported in fall 1942 to Auschwitz and murdered. They lived with a maternal uncle, but due to lack of money and space, were sent together to a children's home. The siblings emigrated to the United States in 1949.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alona Frankel,"Pastel portrait sketches of Ilona and her father created by Ilona Goldman around 1945. During the war, Ilona lived in hiding in Poland from 1942-1944. She made many drawings during this time, especially when, in spring 1942 at age four, she was separated from her parents and placed with the Polish peasant family of Hania Seremet, who agreed to hide her for a fee. These drawings were the only way for the talkative child, not yet able to write, to communicate with her parents. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ilona with her parents, Salomon and Gusta, fled Krakow for Soviet controlled Lvov (Lviv, Ukraine). When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the family was forced into the Jewish ghetto where Salomon worked as an accountant at a meat rendering factory owned by the Wehrmacht. In spring 1942, fearing the liquidation of the ghetto, Salomon arranged a hiding place for them outside the ghetto with a former employee, Jozef Jozak. However, he would not hide Ilona because it would be too hard to conceal a lively young girl. Ilona was smuggled to the countryside and placed in hiding as a Christian child with the Seremets. After 6 months, Salomon could no longer pay for her care, so Ilona was brought back to live in their hiding place, without the knowledge of the Jozak family. Ilona had to stay most of this time locked in a closet with only her drawings and the medical textbooks left by a previous tenant. The family lived in hiding until the Soviet Army liberated the city in July 1944. When the war ended in May 1945, they returned to Krakow.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Edward Vebell,"Portrait of Field Marshall Hermann Göring (Goering) created by 24 year-old Edward Vebell, illustrator and US soldier, from the press gallery during the first months of the 1945 Trial of German Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany. Ed sat in the gallery for three days and used field glasses to capture the details of the defendant's faces. He had no water, so he had to use spit to create the halftones that add detail and nuance. Ed did 90% of his drawing in the courtroom, seeking to bring intimacy to the historical proceedings. The sketches were published in the US Army newspaper Stars and Stripes on December 9, 1945. The Waterman fountain pen he used for the drawings is record 2005.426.1. Ed was drafted into the US Army in 1942, and was the first staff illustrator for Stars and Stripes. His other assignments included combat zones in Italy and France. Soon after the defeat of Nazi Germany on May 7 in western Europe and May 9, 1945, in eastern Europe, the Allies: Great Britain, France, Soviet Union, and the United States convened an International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg, Germany. Its purpose was to seek justice for crimes against humanity, evidenced by the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany. In October 1945, the IMT formally indicted the Nuremberg defendants on four counts: crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and conspiracy to commit these crimes. The verdicts were delivered on October 1, 1946. Twelve defendants were sentenced to death; three to life imprisonment; four to prison terms ranging from 10-20 years; three were acquitted.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Alfred Glück,"Watercolor drawing created by Alfred Glück in 1945-46 in the Hackensecke displaced persons camp in Germany. While at the Bergen Belsen DP camp, Alfred was encouraged by a Czech officer working for UNRRA to make drawings depicting the things he had witnessed during the war. In 1939, eighteen year old Alfred had left Vienna after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. He went to Germany to receive agricultural training at a Hechalutz hachshara in preparation for emigration to Palestine. In 1940, he was sent with other group members to Denmark to work as an agricultural laborer on Danish farms. In 1943, he joined a Hechalutz cell, Der Neue Weg, which had a plan to emigrate illegally to Palestine. The young men stowed away on freight railcars leaving Denmark for Turkey. Alfred was caught by the Germans on the Swiss-German border and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Jaworno subcamp. In early 1945, he underwent two death marches, first to Buchenwald, and then to Bissengen, where he was freed by French soldiers. He settled briefly in Hamburg, then went to the UNRRA displaced persons camp in Bergen Belsen. In 1946, Alfred emigrated to Palestine. The drawing was given to Mordecai E. Schwartz, a former US Army soldier, who served as the Area Director for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) from 1945-1948, when UNRRA was deactivated.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Boris Taslitzky,"Drawing created by Boris Taslitzky in 1945 while he was a prisoner in Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. It depicts a man in an overcoat, sitting on a bench. It was personally inscribed to a close friend in Paris after the war. Taslitzky joined the French military in August 1939 and served with the 101st Infantry Battalion. He was captured by the Germans in June 1940, but escaped and worked for the Resistance until recaptured in November 1941. He was sentenced to prison by a military tribunal for creating Communist propaganda. In 1944, he was deported to Buchenwald. Taslitzky recorded scenes of camp life and several people helped supply him with Papers, and watercolors. Buchenwald was liberated in April 1945. Taslitzky returned to Paris with about 100 drawings and four watercolors which were published in 1946. Throughout his postwar career, he continued to make paintings about the camps and his wartime experiences.","Conditions on Use: Restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Ink and wash drawing by Leo Haas of Mauthausen concentration camp inmates being marched past a hanging. Haas, a Czech Jewish artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist. He was deported to Nisko labor camp in German occupied Poland, returned in April 1940, and assigned to forced labor. In August 1942, he was arrested for smuggling and, with his family, sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp. He and a few other artists secretly documented the horrendous conditions of camp life. In summer 1944, they were accused of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp and jailed and tortured in the Small Fortress. In October, Haas and Bedrich Fritta were deported to Auschwitz, where Fritta soon died. A month later, Haas was sent to Sachsenhausen to work in the counterfeiting unit. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee where he was liberated on May 6 by US troops.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Unknown,"Two pencil drawings side by side on white paper with colored pencil details created by Thea Kelstadt depicting the life of an adult couple in Cleveland Ohio. The left drawing shows the couple separating, while the right shows their reunion. In 1935 Thea married Fred Klestadt. In September, the Nazis announced the Nuremberg Laws which excluded Jews from citizenship and prohibited them from marrying or having sexual relations with persons of German blood. The laws defined a Jew as a person who had 3 or more grandparents that were Jews, regardless of their religious practice. In 1937, fleeing rising German anti-Semitism the couple obtained US visas and immigrated to America in 1937, settling in Cleveland in 1939. In 1955 Thea and Fred adopted Julia Weinstock, a 14 year old Jewish Polish girl whose parents were murdered in the Holocaust. She survived by hiding in a forest bunker near Lvov. When that became too dangerous her grandfather took her and they both hid in a Catholic woman’s house.","Conditions on Use: None provided

Harold Lehman,"Anti-fascist charcoal drawing by Harold Lehman depicting a Spanish Civil War soldier lying face down in hilly terrain with his rifle and helmet strewn before him. Looming behind him are three caricatured heads, likely Adolf Hitler, Francisco Franco, and Benito Mussolini. Both Hitler and Mussolini offered aid to Franco and his fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War. Floating overhead is the saying “No Pasarán” which translates to “they shall not pass.” This was a slogan used by Spanish Communist leader Dolores Ibárruri during the Siege of Madrid. With the combination of the soldier, the phrase and the faces, Lehman is saying that free people would die rather than let the fascists win. The woman and child on the left are symbols of what they are fighting for. An award winning painter, muralist and sculptor, Harold Lehman was known for making political statements with his artwork. He was born and raised in New York City, but moved to Los Angeles as a teenager, attending the Otis Art Institute. While in L.A. he worked with Phil Guston, Jackson Pollock, D.A.

Leo Haas,"Ink sketch of SS officer Wolters drawn by Leo Haas, while a prisoner in Nisko forced labor camp. Leo Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a Communist Party member. He was deported to Nisko in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the wretched conditions of daily life in the camp. In summer of 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp. Haas was arrested and tortured. In October, he was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by US troops.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Liesl J. Loeb,"Trio of drawings on one sheet of paper created by 11 year old Liesl Joseph in August 1939 shortly after arriving in England following the forced return of the MS St. Louis from Cuba. One drawing depicts the ocean liner; one marks each location the ship passed; one depicts the cottage lent to her family by the Rowntree family in England. Liesl and her parents, Josef and Lilly, left Germany soon after the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938. They left on the Hamburg-Amerika luxury liner, MS St. Louis, sailing for Havana on May 13, 1939. The plan was to wait there for permission to enter the US. But Cuban authorities denied entry to all but 28 of the 937 passengers. Josef chaired the passenger committee that tried to find a safe harbor. Liesl remembers feeling that ""as long as my father was involved, we would be all right."" After a week, the ship was ordered to leave. The US government refused to make any exception to the quota limits. The ship was forced to head back to Europe on June 6. Jewish aid organizations negotiated with European governments to admit the passengers rather than return them to Germany. The ship docked in Antwerp, Belgium, on June 17 and the Joseph family continued on to England. Joseph was interned as an enemy alien, but when they received US visas, the family departed on the Cameronia and arrived in the US on September 10, 1940.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Arthur Szyk,"Brightly colored portrait of Heinrich Himmler, head of the Nazi SS, drawn by Arthur Szyk when he was living as a refugee in London in 1939. Himmler holds a list naming the Poles and Jews to be executed. Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939. On September 7, Himmler created the Reich Security Main Office which would coordinate the annihilation of European Jews. Szyk often made clear in his work how practical and deliberate the Nazis were in planning their killing operations. Szyk, a Jewish emigre artist, originally from Łódź, Poland, left London for the United States in 1940. After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, his work focused on anti-Nazi political cartoons. In the US, Szyk became a leading anti-Fascist editorial caricaturist, creating works that brought attention to the mass murder of Europe’s Jews by Nazi Germany.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use

Leo Haas,"Ink sketch of SS officer Siemen drawn by Leo Haas, while a prisoner in Nisko forced labor camp. Leo Haas, 38, a Czech Jew and a professional artist, was arrested in 1939 in Ostrava in German occupied Czechoslovakia for being a member of the Communist Party. He was deported to Nisko in Poland, then shipped back to Ostrava to do forced labor. In September 1942, he was sent to Theresienstadt ghetto-labor camp, where he became part of a tight knit group of artists determined to secretly document the wretched conditions of daily life in the camp. In summer of 1944, they were accused by the Gestapo of smuggling their 'gruesome' work out of the camp. Haas was arrested and tortured. In October, he was deported to Auschwitz, and a month later, to Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, he was transported to Mauthausen and then Ebensee. He was liberated there on May 4-5 by US troops.","Conditions on Use: No restrictions on use
